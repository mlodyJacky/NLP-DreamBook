I don't know what she was doing there, but she was talking to several people who were in front of the table.  I went behind it to talk to her, and casually and unobtrusively put my hand on hers, fully expecting her to pull it away.  To my surprise, however, instead of pulling it away, she squeezed it.  I was thrilled to death.  And then she whispered to me to stop by after class, that she had some good news for me.  I felt sure it had something to do with a change of her feelings toward me, and I was really excited.   In class, we had a substitute teacher.  Mother and my daughter Christina were in the class too.  The substitute made some preliminary remarks at the beginning of the class which led me to wonder if I wasn't in the wrong class.  After class some of the other students were talking to me, and they were all foreign students.  I concluded that it must have been a class in English as a foreign language.  One of the students was especially persistent.  He was complaining about something one of the other students had said in a speech.  I was very impatient to get away from him, because I wanted to talk to Kathy and I wasn't sure whether she might have already gone home.  But as I talked to the guy, I saw her walking toward us and I cut off our conversation rather abruptly and walked to meet her.  Just as we got close enough to begin our conversation, I woke up."

I wasn't too sure I wanted to keep the job, and was made rather anxious by the way the guy showing me around seemed to take for granted the permanence of it.  There was another guy starting at the same time I was, and the office manager was introducing us to everyone.  They were all dressed rather casually, and many were at desks along a hallway rather than in actual offices.  The name of one of the guys was something like Zappelletti.  No one gave me anything to do, so I sat down in front of a color TV in a lounge with another guy.  It was a sort of open-air lounge at the foot of some stairs sort of like the Spanish Steps in Rome, at the top of which was a construction site of some sort."

We were talking about our military experiences.  After a while, the concourse became the underside of the grandstand at a race track.  We were joined by Ellen Walstein who was just getting off work for lunch.  She suggested we have lunch at \"Sardo's.\"  It seems there were enough of us to require 2 cars.  As we walked to the cars, I could see our car (the Sunbeam) a block or more away, and pointed it out to Ellen.  When we got to Sardo's, we looked in the window and saw that it wasn't a very big place, and the tables were all full.  All the men wore coats and ties, too, as did everyone in our group except me.  I felt a little out of place."

She was surprised to see me, though apparently not overjoyed, considering how she had once felt about me.  I walked up to her to greet her and gave her a friendly kiss.  She seemed shocked by this, which surprised me, since she had been the first girl ever to kiss me on the lips.   As I left the supermarket, one of the checkers was coming in the door, and it was either Kendall or Charles Waller.  I gave him a friendly thump on the shoulder or chest and said \"Remember me?\"  I said this because I wasn't sure whether it was Kendall or Charles, since they looked alike and it has been quite a few years since I have seen Charles; I had no doubt that Kendall would remember me.  It was Kendall, and he did remember me-but he wasn't overjoyed to see me either, which really puzzled me.  He walked to the nearest check stand and went right to work, talking to me as he worked.  I then noticed Charles sacking groceries at the next check stand.  Kendall said his father had just died-the day before, I think.  I was shocked, and realized then why he was so somber rather than his usual effusive self.  His hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes were a very sandy color -- more like Albert Fink than like Kendall -- and his eyelashes each seemed separate and distinct; I remember staring at them and at his face.  There was something about his complexion too, that intrigued and somewhat disconcerted me."

I was able to escape notice by floating over the heads of people.  Also by going up to the second floor, where apparently there weren't so many guards.  The longer I remained inside, though, the more anxious I became about getting caught and figuring how to get out, because they check badges on the way out too.  There were a number of short stairways on the second floor, and small rooms with glass windows in the doors.  There was also a very low passage that I tried to crawl through until it became too narrow.  I thought I was done for at 11:00, when the corridors began to fill with people getting off for lunch.  The only person I saw, though, was Norma Grimson, who, to my surprise, didn't seem to be surprised at seeing me or to wonder about my lack of a badge.  Apparently she and some others were going to a luncheon, and she asked me if Bonita hadn't given me the message about it.  I asked, \"Connie Hutchinson or my wife?\"  She raised an eyebrow at that, and replied (I believe), \"Connie Hutchinson.\"  I would have liked to go with them, but I couldn't get out without a badge.  Later, after numerous close calls, I somehow came by the badge of a Navy officer.  His eyes and hair looked enough like mine, but he had a rather smashed-in mouth, with missing teeth.  I left in a crowd at 5:00 and rushed through the gatehouse, holding my thumb over the lower part of the picture.  I held it up for the guard to see, and he let me through."

I found several guys playing football in the yard beside the house.  I was delighted to note that, with the addition of me, the teams would be even.  They decided whose team I would be on, but before I even got on the field, the other team punted to my team.  I was just off the right sideline as we looked toward our goal, and I ran on the field, caught the punt in the air and on the run, and dashed straight down the sideline.  There was only one guy between me and the goal, and he tagged me.  I couldn't figure out why I hadn't tried to run around him.  It had been a good runback, though, and I expected more recognition than I got.  Later, at this same house, I got thick letters in the mail from 4-5 friends.  This often happens in dreams, but this time I was convinced it was real and not a dream, and it took me a while to accept reality even after awakening, and then it was very disappointing."

I was buying some soft drinks, in all sizes and shapes of bottles and jars, taking them off a shelf against the front wall of the store where the pop box used to be and putting them in an empty case.  It was taking me much longer than I wanted it to, and I was very frustrated with the different sizes and shapes.  At one point, when Gov. Wallace was waiting on another customer at the counter, he called out to me, \"Hey friend.\" or \"Hey you over there\" or something like that, and I thought, \"He's forgotten my name again.\" and wondered if I should suggest that he get a PR man to help him remember names; it seems that I had observed before that he was bad about that.  When I answered him, he asked me if I had ever played \"Molda.\"  The name sounded familiar to me, and I asked him how it was played.  He recited a little two- or four-line poem that was part of the rules.  I liked the guy in spite of myself and wondered if I should engage him in some kind of debate on the subjects on which we differed.  The only other conversation I remember, though, was my congratulating him on his recent marriage.  He acknowledged the congratulations, but for some reason didn't seem overly enthusiastic or happy, and I surmised that he must be still mourning Lurleen."

I rode around a mountain with someone in some type of conveyance to get a better look at the slopes or something.  Then I started climbing a mountain with Alberta.  It was sort of like a pyramid, in that steps were carved into the sides, and it was fairly easy to climb.  When we got very high, though, the steps became very narrow and slightly sloped on the treads-but by the time we realized it, it was too late to go up or down.  And as we stayed in one spot, clinging to the side of the mountain, I became less and less sure of my grip.  Alberta was calm and almost resigned-to keep me from panicking, I felt.  I was desperate to find something to grab hold of.  Suddenly I saw a fire extinguisher on the side of the mountain.  I didn't want to lunge for it, for fear I would pull it loose, so I slowly took a firm grip on it.  It was a better grip than I had had before, but I was still almost crazy with fear, because there was no way to get down."

Then I was playing football, either among some dormitories on a college campus or among some apartment buildings.  We weren't really playing a game, just tossing the ball around.  There were numerous trees, and they always seemed to be in the way of long passes I wanted to throw.  The timing had to be perfect in order to have your receiver in the right position to throw to him through openings through the limbs, but the ball was slightly bigger around than ones I am used to, and it kept slipping out of my hand at the moment I was about to throw.  Then, because I couldn't grip it well, I couldn't throw it as far as I knew I could otherwise, and my passes kept falling short."

At one point, at someone's house, she sat on top of a cabinet or refrigerator, with her legs apart.  She was wearing a dress, and I kept stealing glances at her, afraid someone else would notice.

I asked to be excused and left the room somewhat doubled over.  Bill came out with me to see if there was anything he could do.  I decided the best thing to do was to confide in him.  Somehow his wife was there too, and I told them both.  I told them that I had had numerous dreams about being in the the agency building without a badge-and now I really was, and I thought I was going crazy.  Either then or later they advised me to go to security and explain the whole thing to them.  First, however, they got a doctor or a nurse, or both, to come and give me some kind of sedative to calm me and maybe put me to sleep.  We were then outdoors, and I was supposed to lie down beside a culvert until an ambulance came for me.  While I was there, feeling very groggy, several friends and Bonita came by to see how I was.  I remember thinking how long Bill had been away from his class and worried that they would give up on his coming back.  I also wished the sedative would finish putting me to sleep or that the ambulance would come.  Finally it came and I struggled to get on the stretcher.

I could also see that only the right hand lane was one way in her direction; the lane next to it could go in either direction, and in fact, cars approaching each other sometimes passed on each other's left.  This seemed to me a very dangerous situation, and I was glad to see that Bonita kept all the way to the right.  Next, I was in the car as we approached from the rear a big car transport truck and apparently drove right up its ramp.  Anyway, the road ahead became steeper and steeper, and I had to shift down to third (I was now driving.), and in doing so, and climbing even steeper, I lost more speed and had to shift down again.  Then we were traveling straight up, and just as I expected, we began to pitch backward from the surface and fall toward the water. Later, I had to fill out a report on the accident.  I can't remember whether it was the same evening or the next morning, whether I had survived the accident or had been miraculously re-transplanted from it before it occurred.  Gaylen Tuttleson was involved in directing me in the initial phase of the paperwork I had to do, and later Becky Hellman.  I remember having written, or seeing written, in the \"Injuries\" space:  \"Driver killed.\"  Bonita was dead-no doubt about that.  Several people, some of them acquaintances, asked about the accident, but showed little emotion when I told them Bonita was dead.  I was in sort of a daze myself."

After the first half inning, some of them had to go back and do some work (they had been on their lunch break), and the game was temporarily halted.

He said 50 cents, and I fumbled with my change with one hand until I got two quarters isolated and dropped them into the fare box.  Then I made my way back to the rear of the bus, where my friend was seated on the rear seat.  There was just enough space left, and I squeezed in next to her.

The jet appeared to be on a collision course with the dirigible, which was motionless, but it was fairly obvious that this was an optical illusion because they were simply in my line of sight but the dirigible was farther away.  One or the other began descending rapidly -- too rapidly and at too steep an angle, it seemed to me -- toward the airport.  I was aghast, because I was sure it was going to crash and explode before my very eyes.  (Actually there were buildings of some sort blocking my direct view of the runway.)  To my surprise, however, the plane was built at such an angle that although the rear half was at a sharp angle with the ground, the front half was almost parallel to it-sort of like some helicopters are designed.  So it didn't crash.  It was carrying a load of VWs, though, and when the plane emerged to the right of the buildings which had blocked my view of it, the wind had caught the VWs and they were flying in the air and bouncing frighteningly on the runway.

Also, there were few people in there, and I looked in vain for someone I knew to eat with.  I chose the special, which was a sort of stew or goulash, and they must have been almost out all right, because it was a few tiny lumps of hamburger, a couple of mushy pieces of cooked carrot, and a little spaetzle.  I complained to the servers about how little I was getting for 89 cents or whatever the price was, and they took my dish back to give me more.  Jim Plummer was there, and he had set four places at the table.  I commented to his wife on how helpful he was and sat down to eat.  He had already eaten and was waiting for the first baseball exhibition game to come on TV.  I eagerly waited with him.  It was supposed to be the Red Sox vs. the Reds, but when we turned on the TV, it was Mohammad Ali vs. some other guy in a boxing ring.  We were disappointed and couldn't figure out how it could have gotten mixed up like that.  Round One had just begun, and Ali came out slugging.  He pummeled the other guy a few times, and the guy staggered backwards to his corner, holding his arms up, conceding the fight.  He was a much older, thinner man, and his eyes were wide with terror, his mouth wide open and his teeth glistening.  The people in his corner tried to get him to go back out, but he refused, and then he toppled through the ropes and fell out of the ring.  A ringside doctor pronounced him dead."

The chair jacked up like a barber chair, and he kept jacking me up, up, up-almost to the ceiling.  It was a fairly high ceiling, too.  He was on a stand that came up that high too.  The waiting room was in the same room, and in two chairs on the side of the room opposite me sat Judy Waldron and Larry Poponovo.  I thought about telling Larry about how often I had dreamed about him, but decided he might think I was weird or something.  I suggested some plan for keeping up with our high school classmates-something like a newsletter or an exchange of personal newsletters, but they didn't go for the idea.  I admitted to them that I was rather sentimental about high school days.  When the dream began, the office building was completely dark, but open, and I was wandering around in it wondering if the dentist had gone home or was on vacation or something, when I bumped into Gary.  Later, I thought of something else I needed to have done, or something I needed to ask him, just after he had left.  There was something like a screened-in porch, and I ran out on it to shout at him as he drove away.  Even though he had driven some distance down the street, I could see his face clearly in his rear view mirror.  He showed no response to my shouting and waving, even when looking directly at me in the mirror."

I hung on to the boat, or something else which was afloat, but Bonita started to swim.  I was very worried, because the water was very choppy and it was a long, long way to shore.  However, she seemed to be making remarkably good progress, and since I was worried about her getting too far out of reach, I started swimming after her.  To my surprise, I too made good progress, swimming very fast.  She got the willies from feeling things brush against her under water, and at one point I saw a huge sea turtle pass just beneath her.  Once we got into a thick patch of tall reeds, which made me nervous because of what might be among them but was also somewhat reassuring because we had something to cling to in case we tired.  We continued to make good progress, though, and soon found ourselves in a long, narrow inlet lined with bushes and trees, whose branches interlocked overhead to form a sort of tunnel -- so much so, and so long was it, that the tunnel appeared to be closed at the far end, and at that end we actually saw a light -- the light at the end of the tunnel.  When we got there, the water became very shallow and just kind of petered out into a dirt street in a run-down section of town."

Uncle Jack and his family (all -- or at least most -- of it), Uncle Albert and his, John and Lois and their kids, and more that I can't remember.  Somewhere in the house where we were alone, Jody walked by me on her way to the bathroom, and she was naked from the waist up.  I reached out and felt one of her breasts.  When she returned from the bathroom, I did it again, and this time she reprimanded me. Later, we all got in three cars and headed for New York, to see Doug and Marilyn.  I was glad, because I wondered how they liked the record I sent them.  My sister Nancy and my daughter Christina were in the car I was in, with 5 other people, including some of Uncle Jack's family and possibly Grandpa and Grandma.  At least once I was with Grandpa and Grandma, because Grandpa asked me if I wanted to drive the rest of the way.  My sister Nancy was much younger-about 7 or 8, I guess; she was very precocious and had very dark hair.  I felt there were too many people in our car, and I wanted to change to another one, but when the other two pulled alongside, I found that they were just as crowded.  One of them was even a small bus.  Part of the time I was riding in a car driven by Uncle Joe; it's very confusing.  I remember going through some little town that looked like Germany.  We weren't making very rapid progress, and finally stopped at some motel in MixJunction.  It was a huge room, all glass, with beds enough for all of us in it.  I was very uneasy for John and Lois, what with their being among all these relatives of mine and being delayed in their trip; I knew how I would have felt under those circumstances.  They had just planned on a short visit with my wife Bonita and me, and got caught up in all this.  Anyway, it seemed so stupid to have to spend the night between two major cities  (To say nothing of spending it in MixJunction.)  I suspected Thad had something to do with it, or Uncle Joe, who seemed to take a circuitous route, but when I complained to Mother about it, she said it was Fred or Effie's idea-but just as she said it, she saw through an open door Fred and Effie, who had just driven up, getting out of their car, and she clammed up.  Fred had a beard and looked sort of like Dr. Knowland.  I was surprised they had chosen this place, because it was pretty dingy."

To get there I had to go through a part of town with very narrow streets lined with very tall (8-10 stories) apartment buildings.  They were multicolored-each apartment in the same building seemed to be a different color outside.  And there were an unbelievable number of people with their heads sticking out windows-out of almost every window.  They all seemed to be black, and they were all watching me.  It made me a bit nervous.  After that I had to walk through a street with ruins on either side, sort of like the Roman Forum.  Here I was afraid I was going to be attacked by muggers.  The mansion itself, though, when I finally got there, was a very enjoyable experience-though unfortunately I don't remember what made it so.  Some friend with a sort of British accent  was showing a group of us through the place, and it was fascinating.  In the process I formed a mutual attraction with a girl on the tour; maybe that accounts for the pleasantness, but I was also really taken with the place, and I believe I was going to live there or something."

One or the other of us, or friends, were in canoes or other small boats in these pictures, alongside a sheer high bank or some manmade structure like a pavilion or monument located on the bank.  We hadn't finished going through this stuff when it was time to go to bed, or leave, or both, I'm not sure.  Anyway, that activity ceased, and I was down on the streets of the city.  It was dark, early in the morning-maybe 5 or 6 a.m.  I went into a large, almost empty first floor room in a building whose door was open, looking for breakfast.  Someone had had a party there the night before, but about the only thing left to eat was some cold pizza.  Some guy arrived just after I did, to open the place, but he didn't have anything to eat."

It was being conducted by Neil Findley and a brother who looked just like him except that he had red hair.  Phil Darter and some other warrant officer from the agency were in the audience.  The meeting was on some political subject.  At one point, I voiced my opinion on some issue, and my voice sounded strange to me -- rather high-pitched.  I expected Darter and some of the others I knew to turn around and see me and be surprised by my beard, but they didn't.  After the meeting I went up to Neil and asked him if he remembered me.  At first he didn't, but then he did-but he didn't seem excited at all about seeing me.  I also spoke to his wife.

We had gone up two flights and were starting the third.  I was telling her about having met 5 astronauts, and possibly the President, on some occasion, when my legs gave way and wouldn't carry me any farther.  She asked if she should call a doctor, and I said yes-it seemed like a good idea to have this persistent malady investigated finally and find out what it was all about.  I was afraid, though, that they were going to ask \"Is there a doctor in the house?\" over the public address system, and I would be embarrassed.  However, they sent for a specific doctor, whose name was Whitman or Whitmore.  I wished after she had gone that I had asked her to call a psychiatrist, but it was too late then. I don't remember how the examination went, but I remember being with a group of people in someone's back yard and either finding a letter for me in the barbecue pit or having it handed to me there.  It was from Dick Lingerman, and although it didn't mention my legs specifically, I had the distinct impression that that's what it was about.  He wanted me to bring Christina and accompany him to New Guinea or New Zealand.  Apparently it had to do with some kind of therapy for my legs, so I figured it must be a very serious disorder.  I was very excited about the prospect of the trip, of course, but as I read further, the letter became blurry and I couldn't make it out.  This was upsetting, because I began to sense that this was a dream and would fade away when I woke up."

We were passing the football around, but it was in some small back yard, and there were always fences, gates, trees, etc. in the way.  Besides, every time I tried to throw a pass, I couldn't get a good grip on the ball.  The biggest problems were getting my hand on the right place on the ball and keeping my fingers from crossing when I tried to grip it.  It is very hard to throw a football any distance with two of your fingers crossed.  Every time someone would run out, by the time I could grip the ball properly (if ever), they were well out of my range.  It was very frustrating.  I have had this sort of dream before.  Once, though, when a black guy ran out, I did manage to throw a good one -- over his head, even -- in fact I thought it was too long, especially since he was coming to a terrace.  Just as he went over the edge of the terrace, though, he slowed down, casually stuck one arm out in front of him, and hauled the pass in with one hand, without even looking.  There were quite a few black guys, and about 10-12 of us altogether.  Someone said they knew a better place to play, so we started off through several back yards to get there.  We also had to go through Uncle Jack's house.  I remember talking first to Patty and then to Aunt Thelma.  I guess it was the house where they used to live in my hometown.  Aunt Thelma said we couldn't play in their yard right then for some reason, but that we could come back and play at night.  I thought, \"Big deal.  How far can you see a football at night, with no lights?\""

By then, my class was about half over anyway.  Somehow it also turned out that I was going to have to ride a motorcycle, either alone or with Bonita, which I wanted to do, but when I tried to put on my helmet, it wouldn't fit for some reason, which meant that I was going to have to make a complete change of clothes.

I was disgusted, and when an appropriate time came -- a pause for getting a movie ready or something -- I made for the exit.  To my embarrassment, about half the audience took that as their cue to leave too, including Pedro.  We walked a ways together, till we came to where he was staying-a large treehouse dormitory.  I wondered about Yolanda, but didn't know whether I should ask.  He volunteered the information that she was in a room in the back which adjoined his room.   Later I found myself in bed by a window opposite a similar dormitory.  I could see very plainly through the window opposite, because we were separated only by the narrowest of passageways.  There were two women in the other room-one in bed and the other attending to her.  One was nude, or partially so, and they were pondering the advisability of lowering their blinds.  I pretended to be asleep, however, so they decided not to.  Apparently the one in bed was pregnant, or had just had a baby and needed milk, because the other one began to breast feed her.

On the way home I had to stop and get a few things at a supermarket.  The kid who checked me out was very young, and he obviously didn't know what he was doing.  When he gave me my change, what was supposed to be several 1's were actually a mixture of 5's, 10's, 20's, and 1's.  I pointed it out to him, and he seemed to be confused and put the whole stack back in one compartment of the till.  The bag boy took my groceries out, and when he came back in he asked if he could borrow a nickel.  I had already planned to give him a nickel and five pennies, so I gave him two nickels and a penny instead.

Bonita didn't think she could spare the time, and wasn't particularly interested in going anyway, so I decided to go by myself.  I felt a bit guilty about going without her, because I knew how possessive she is about weekends, and I tried to figure out how I could spend only part of the time with them and still enjoy it, and be able to spend the rest of it with her.  There was a telephone in our room, but I didn't know the number; so when I had left the building, I thought I should have it, and I threw a little rock up at her window.  When I got her attention and asked her for the number, someone near me replied with the number which must have been the main number for the dorm, but I told him we had a phone in our room.  I vaguely remember several experiences in connection with going to see John and Lois.  In one, Terrence Bailey was going with me.  Still at my alma mater, we went to the dorm for something (in the direction of Clark Hall, actually), and found the whole dorm was gone.  While we were sitting or squatting in front of where the dorm should have been, a whole bunch of soldiers popped up from a line of concealed foxholes, and we were caught in the middle of some kind of battle; I was embarrassed at having been taken by surprise.  We were taken to a temporary building then, where I was supposed to see a major.  While waiting outside his office with others, some of them were looking at my field jacket and trying to figure out my rank.  In one place I still had a single bar, in another the double bar.  I began to worry that I would get in trouble for being out of uniform, even though I was off active duty -- and also self-conscious about having a beard while in uniform.  So I told Doug Sterme (who now takes the place of Terrence Bailey) that we could just sneak away, since they didn't know our names.At some other time, I was also in a waiting room with some other men, none of them in uniform, when someone asked me who was the highest ranking man there.  We all kind of looked at each other, then one man raised his hand and said, \"I'm a captain.\"  Whereupon I replied, \"I'm a major.\"  When we got out of one or the other of these places, I was with Terrence again, and we were looking for my car.  It was a small foreign car, apparently fairly new, and I couldn't remember where I had parked it.  We walked up and down the nearby streets.  I think Tarver finally gave up and went some other way, and I went to my house and asked Daddy where it was.  He told me, but I don't remember what came of it, because I became somehow faced with the prospect of walking to my destination.  It would be via hilly, dusty country roads, and about the distance from Mother's house in my hometown to where Uncle Jack used to live in my hometown-about 12 miles.  Apparently I had walked it before, but this time my legs started collapsing.  And I had to climb a cyclone fence with barbed wire on top, on the edge of a short but steep embankment near something like a gas station.  I didn't know if I could make it, and was afraid besides that I might get in trouble for climbing the fence.  So all these things conspired to force me to retrace my steps to a sort of tourist information office.  Connie Hutchinson was inside.  I had to go to the bathroom the same time she did, and she said we could go at the same time.  She led me there, locked the door, and showed me how she could urinate standing up.I don't remember how I finally made it to where John and Lois were staying, but I did, and it was an old house on a highway resembling the main drag in Ocean City."

I caught a bus, and apparently was in a good frame of mind and among friends.  When we came to my stop, the bus was so crowded that I couldn't get to the door before it started up again, and I actually had to crawl along a narrow space between the ceiling and the tops of people's heads.  And when the bus started up again, I yelled, \"Stop the damn bus-I'm trying to get off.\"  and everyone laughed, including the bus driver; I was amused myself.  Later when I was coming to and from school I rode the subway, in which occasionally three different trains crisscrossed over each other at different levels above the ground.

Raul checked it once, but there had been some group singing right before everyone departed, and there was some stupid regulation that the tower had to be checked after anyone had sung or spoken-even though everyone was right around the foot of the ladder.  The \"barn\" began to look more like the narthex of a tiny cathedral.  It must have been after checking the tower (I don't remember actually doing it) that I was descending the side of a building.  I don't remember much except coming down the sheer side groping for fingerholds and footholds in the brick and stone construction.

The whole walk had overtones of a cross country walk, though, and I actually thought of Charles Kuralt's \"On the Road\" feature on CBS.  At one point I was consulting a U.S. map and figured I had walked most of the way around the coast of Florida, and wondered if part of my walk hadn't been down the coast to Florida.  Anyway, I had left Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's house.  I never walked on the beltway, but my route followed the general direction of the beltway-i.e. I was never far outside it or far inside it.  I kept anticipating having leg-collapsing problems at any time, but never did.  At one point, I was walking through a wooded area and my path converged with that of another guy.  Soon we came to a tunnel.  I was apprehensive that he might make homosexual overtures, but he didn't.  We entered the tunnel and turned to our right.  When we emerged from it, we were in a construction site, sort of like that at National Cathedral, with big chunks of ornamental marble and concrete lying around.  The other guy picked some up and carried it on his back for a while.  He suggested I do the same, but I refused, expressing amazement that he should help someone else do the work that they were getting paid for.Soon thereafter our paths parted, and I entered the ground level of a sort of stadium.  To enter the playing area there were turnstiles you had to pass through, and the admission was 25 cents.  I was reluctant, because I was short on funds on this walk, but it was sponsored by the Girl Scouts or some church or something, so I went ahead.  I found myself going against a line of people coming out through the turnstile, but I made it OK.  I was thinking at this point that it would be cold enough when night came that it might be uncomfortable sleeping outdoors, since I wore shorts and was barefoot.  I considered going back to the Stermes' each night and coming back each morning to resume my walk where I had left off, but that seemed impractical -- at least it would necessitate having someone come and get me every day, and besides, I had a romantic ideal of doing it all myself -- walking all the way around the beltway or cross country or whatever, sleeping out, living off the land, and seeing life in the U.S. as people seldom see it anymore when they travel.I emerged onto the playing area of the stadium, which was really just a park.  A lot of people were playing croquet-at least they had a huge croquet set, had team colors to match their mallets, etc.  It looked like a very big deal, an organized thing, or I would have tried to get in on it.  The strange thing, though, was that they were actually playing baseball using the balls and mallets.  I walked near the batter, and he was swinging wildly, heedless of me, and I bawled him out as I walked away, but he paid no attention.Beyond this field was a terrace above which I saw my sister Nancy  Diah and Omar and some other mothers and children.  Rick Adams was playing catch there with some other guys I knew, and I was impressed by how hard they could throw.  I figured it was because they were tall.  I asked Nancy if there was a telephone nearby, just as I stepped through the broken door of a telephone booth lying on its side.  She pointed to the Little Tavern, alongside which Rick and the other guys were playing, so I decided I would use this phone.  Just then I heard someone from below the terrace call \"Queen.\" or \"Queenie.\"  At first I thought he might be calling me, though I couldn't figure out why that way, but then some woman came up behind me from the right, between me and the Little Tavern, and it was obvious that he was talking to her.  She was horribly ugly, her face a mass of wrinkled flesh and absolutely white as chalk.  She looked in the window and asked the guy who called her if that was homemade, pointing to a pie that she saw through the window.  He said yes, and she asked him to give her half of it.  He was incredulous that she should want such a large amount, but she stuck by her request."

I threatened not to pay at all, and she got mad.  I was infuriated, and even though I knew it would upset Bonita, I fought with the lady rather than put my shoes on.  The next thing I knew, Bonita was pulling my suitcase and things out of the car and throwing them onto the ground.  I tried to talk to her, but I knew it was useless.  I started getting a few things together for Christina.  Bonita and her mother started pointing out places of interest in Arizona, saying I could see them and be back in a week.  On the way out of some building, I ran into Dr. Knowland and told him I was leaving."

Kent Heudson and some other GI's from the agency were there.  Kent and I especially had been kidding each other, but I was embarrassed when he cut up out loud and called attention to us while the proceedings were going on.  Afterwards I realized that he had hidden my tiki (the one my wife Bonita brought back from Hawaii), and I was twisting his arm, along with that of one of his confederates, to make them tell me where it was.  I was rather serious about it, because it was time for me to leave, but his arm was so flexible and limber that I couldn't hurt him very much.  Audrey Sturgeon was nearby, and I guess I thought she was in on it, because I got mad and pulled the top of her dress down to her waist.  She was wearing a slip.  Later I went up to her and apologized and tried to kiss her, but she was still mad and wouldn't let me.  Apparently many of us had changed clothes there, because she was looking for her black dress and couldn't find it before leaving.  When I went into one of the dressing rooms or bathrooms to get my stuff, her dress and shoes were in there, and I hoped I could take them to her and redeem myself, but she had gone.  I had been wearing my dress green uniform, and when I put the jacket back on I noticed that the rank insignia were missing, as was the US and the branch insignia.  Actually, they were all in a little pile.  There were other officers -- higher ranking -- nearby, and I was afraid they would see me that way and embarrassed that they might have seen me like that when I came in.  At this point I was getting dressed in a wire mesh locker room.  When I got ready to leave the place, I ran into Rhonda Addilio at the door.  I told her I was embarrassed to admit it, but that Bonita and I had been in Rome a few months before, but just hadn't had time to call her.  She seemed to understand (or not to care).When I went to my car, I couldn't find it.  When I saw one I thought was mine (a blue Plymouth, I think), a black guy got into it ahead of me, and I decided it wasn't mine after all.  It was raining, so I was offered a ride by Ellen Otto and her mother and sister.  As we drove, we passed a row of theaters showing skin flicks.  They had posters all over the outside, and they were along a sort of mall.  Mrs. Otto drove very slowly as we went by, so we could look at the pictures.  When I left the Ottos, I went back on my own and went in one of the theaters.  It was a big theater, and I was in the balcony.  When I was seated, an usher came up to me and asked me for my card.  I said I didn't have one, and he asked me to get one from the guy out in the hall.  I thought about asking him how much they were, but decided it would be more appropriate to just ask the guy outside.  The feature had just ended when I got up.  There were a lot of women in the theater, some of them alone.  One sat down by herself at the end of my row, and I thought I would sit down beside her when I came back.  Outside there was a box, and I was instructed to put 50 cents in it.  For this, the guy gave me an envelope containing a plastic card which I assumed must have been a membership card.  When I went back in, I had to give it to the usher, and I wondered how he would know who to give it back to.  Someone else had sat down beside the girl."

I was on an army bus with a lot of other guys, and we were going to some kind of training.  Everyone had on fatigues, but I felt that I had on my Class A uniform.  I figured we were going to go through the gas chamber, since that probably would have occurred late in our training, and someone was heard to remark, \"They won't issue you one (a gas mask, I assumed) unless you are in fatigues\"-which made me even more concerned about being out of uniform.  Then I noticed, however, that I did have on fatigues after all.  When the bus came to a stop, though, and everyone got off, I realized I didn't have my headgear-which I for some reason expected to be my service cap, not the fatigue cap.  I didn't know what to do, and I hesitated at the door of the bus.  Then the driver handed me a hat.  It was still not a fatigue cap, but a garrison cap.  I thought that would be all right, because it was interchangeable with the service cap, and I was much relieved.  As I left the bus, I noticed that the cap had a single bar on it--the light was too dim to tell whether it was silver or gold-but underneath the cloth, somewhere inside the cap, I could feel the captain's insignia, so I knew I could change the one on the outside.  I had to do it while walking, though, and it was difficult because of the dim light and the fact that the one on the outside was the pin-on type and therefore rather tedious to remove.  When I got inside the building where we had stopped, I was still fiddling with the cap insignia, and the rest of the guys had disappeared; try as I might, I couldn't locate them."

At one point I saw some nurses and they gave me further directions.  One of them was rather attractive, and looked sort of like Sister Frances Aid at the university where I work.  Later I was lounging on the grass with her, like between the library and the science building at my alma mater.  There was a very warm and affectionate relationship between us.  It was noon, and I remembered I had promised some little old lady to meet her for lunch at a nearby cafeteria, off campus.  I really hated to leave our spot there, but the girl understood and came along with me as if by prior arrangement.  She and the older lady knew each other; I think they worked at the same place.  At the cafeteria, we had to go down an escalator.  Just as I got on it, I saw Joan Morris on the floor we were just leaving.  I called to her, and she seemed pleased to see me.  I asked her if it was true that she had gotten married.  She said it was, and I congratulated her and asked her what her new name was.  She said it was Linda Canyada.  I thought it was odd that she had changed her first name too.  There was a freshman football player named Jerry Canyada in my dorm section my senior year, and I wondered if that was whom she had married.  We were right on time to meet the little old lady.  Later on, I was back at the original house with all the doors, trying to remember the way I had made it through before."

It was about 8:40 at the time.  He was going to be in \"West Virginia\" the next day and wondered if we could get together.  (I put quotes around WV, because I suggested that I drive up and meet him in Bloomsburg, PA.)  I either had in mind or actually suggested the Hotel Magifore as a meeting place.  (The interstate buses stop there.)  We agreed to get together, but after I hung up, I realized that I should have suggested that we could spend the night at the Lingerman's farm nearby.  When I hung up it was just after 8:45, so I quickly dialed 699-7469 (although I was worried about getting some interference from the radio, which was nearby and not turned down).  I didn't talk to Bob (or Doug) but reached someone else, who promised to relay my message (of best wishes, good job, etc.).

He turned around and was very pleased and surprised that I knew who he was.  He thanked me profusely.  It made me feel good.

The rest of us got off at the next stop and walked back to the barber shop.  There was a little diner adjoining it, and we went in and sat down at a booth.  There were windows between the diner and the barber shop, and I could see a sign which, though partially obscured, apparently advertised \"the university haircuts.\"  I mentioned it to Mother, and she said she had seen another sign from the bus window which she thought had said that, but she hadn't been sure.  Now that she mentioned it, I remembered seeing it too.  I also noticed that haircuts were 50 cents or 55 cents.

We were sitting at two long benches at separate tables, with our backs to the tables, so that we were facing each other rather than the tables.  Someone (male) at the opposite end of my bench was naked, and I sort of put myself in his situation and remembered the times I had been (in dreams) naked in public.  Soon, though, almost everyone was naked (though I never saw them disrobe).  Everyone on the bench opposite me was naked; all were men, and they were leaning slightly to their right, bent slightly forward, and staring soberly at the floor, as if to affect a humorous pose, sort of like in a barbershop quartet.  Since the few remaining clothed people were taking off their clothes, I figured Bonita couldn't object if I took mine off too, so I did.  Our bench then also struck a pose similar to the others, but leaning in the opposite direction.After that, it degenerated into an orgy.  Under a table to my left rear were two people under an opaque plastic sheet.  I couldn't tell who they were.  In a few minutes I looked again and they were gone, but nearby, and out from under the table (which was now a bar) was Bonita and another girl sitting on the floor-so I figured it had been them under the sheet.  Bonita rather coolly ordered me to go outside and get some blanket (the cats' pink blanket, I think) and take it somewhere.  I figured she just wanted to get rid of me so that she and the girl could make love \"in private.\"  Bonita said it was because the girl wanted the blanket, but that didn't make sense to me-why then was I supposed to take it somewhere?  Instead, I went to the opposite side of the room where a girl, clothed, was sitting against the wall.  Standing over her and facing the same direction was just a pair of legs from the waist down, also clothed.  She had been sucking its cock, so I figured she would suck mine too.  Somehow I now had my trousers on.  I unfastened them, and she was eagerly kissing my belly and impatiently pulling down my pants.  I thought she had stopped sucking the other one, because it wouldn't get an erection.  When she started sucking mine, it felt good, but she suddenly stopped and made a face and said \"Ugh, yours tastes like pee pee too.\"  I was very disappointed, because it had been some time since I had urinated.  (This girl, by the way, is in my statistics class.  She looks slightly Asian, but speaks with a Spanish accent.  She is very confident and intelligent -- almost cocky -- no pun intended.)Now we were on the roof of a building, next to the edge, and I was lying beside her.  I whispered in her ear, \"Let's fuck, then.\"  Unfortunately I don't recall what followed, but when I got up I saw Bonita at the bar and she was fighting hard unsuccessfully to hold back the tears, and finally she stalked out of the place.  I thought it was terribly hypocritical of her, since I was sure she had been carrying on her share of the orgy.  When I got home, I found the slide projector out and several slides still in the projector.  I picked some up and looked at them to see if I could get a clue as to why she got them out, but they were nothing out of the ordinary.  Somehow I knew that Bonita was \"downstairs\" or next door talking to Lourdes Flynnery."

Vernon Tolson was working there, but the only other the agency people I knew were Jim Plummer  and Norma Grimson.  Jim was briefing me on a problem he was working on, and bringing me up to date on my files.  At one point I suddenly realized that I didn't have my badge, and I couldn't figure out for the life of me how I got in the building.  But then I felt in my shirt pocket and found that I did indeed have one.  Then I was puzzled about how I got one on such short notice, since it seemed they had called me up and asked me to come back and work temporarily, because they were shorthanded or something.  Even that seemed odd to me, as it would in real life.  Norma was sort of filling me in on things.  I asked her if she was now branch chief, and she said they were no longer organized that way, that she was chief of the data branch-all reports had to go through her.  I assumed Bill Clay had charge of all the secret codes in his branch, and apparently I was right, but when I looked in their area, no one was there-out to lunch, I surmised.

I leaned way into each one in case I could reach one.  The next pitch was good, but I missed it.  I would have swung regardless, because I didn't want to walk.  The next two pitches were also good, and I swung and missed both of them and struck out. What frustration to see that ball hanging up there so temptingly, to eagerly anticipate lashing out and feeling a good solid thump-only to swish through emptiness and not get another chance.  The pitch I struck out on didn't have much of an arc, and I asked someone if it conformed to slow pitch regulations.  I didn't get an answer.  I decided I must have been deceived by his motion, which was quick, but the ball was not delivered fast. The game must have been held up by rain-I think it was overcast and threatening when I joined it.  While we were waiting to resume, I was talking to Jimmy Creager and expressing my eagerness to get started again.  He said he hoped it would be rained out.

We liked it, and sat down at the dining room table with the two of them to talk over the terms.  At this point the chronology becomes very confused.  Bonita sort of disappeared, and I fell for the daughter.  I had to go to the bathroom, and was directed to a room off a narrow hallway.  It looked like a barber shop-it was long and narrow, with seats on one side and mirrors on the other.  The side adjacent to the hallway was all glass; nevertheless, I was somewhat abashed that Bonita (I think) failed to shut the door when I went in.  So there I was sitting high up on a barber chair, which turned out to be a toilet seat, with my pants around my ankles, and people walking back and forth past the open door.  No one seemed to be inclined to look in, though (it was a little dark in there anyway), so I didn't want to call anyone's attention to me by calling to them and asking them to close the door.  And I couldn't get up and shut it myself, because I had half a turd hanging out.  Once I started to get up, then noticed it hanging there, and had a hard time getting it back in the toilet seat hole, which was small.  Then the daughter came in to talk to me.  At first I was embarrassed, but then I was aroused by the intimacy.After she was gone, a navy commander arrived in the house and was \"announced\"-by a butler, I guess.  Everyone was supposed to stand up when he walked by, and I felt uneasy that I couldn't when he walked by the open door.  He didn't look in, but in a few minutes either he or another navy officer were in the same room with me, leaning up against the wall on my side and smoking.  I decided then would be a good time to get down and get out of there.  For some reason, I then had to go home and get something.  With everyone watching, I took a running leap and began to fly.  I didn't imagine I was Superman, but I could hear the Superman music.  Our apartment was in the middle of town.  When I came back, it was all I could do to stay off the ground-I couldn't gain any altitude until I got back nearly to the house.   When I returned to the original house, it was evening, and everyone -- the lady, the daughter, and a son -- was in the living room playing some word game using dice.  They rolled several dice and then picked them up by poking little white toothpicks into the spots.  The toothpicks were clustered so that there were as many different combinations as there were spots, and they fit exactly into all spots.  They didn't always hold when they were stuck in, though.  The object of the game was to make words with the dice when they were picked up (they had letters on each face)-and you could turn them any way you wanted to; you didn't have to use the faces that came up when you rolled them."

They had been able to see the frog hopping up and down from where they were; I don't know whether I knew this before I brought the frog, and I don't remember how they reacted when I showed up with the frog.  That they could have seem him from where they worked was interesting, because of the distance, the fact that he would have had to jump really high in order for them to see him over the clutter, and the fact that he was in a cage when I first saw him."

While I waited, I went next door and visited, taking two cats, Tonya and Minnie ,with me.  While I was there, a black fellow -- a friendly guy and apparently a dorm monitor -- came in to conduct room inspection.  He was a guy whose face wasn't familiar to me.  He wore wire rim glasses.  His first name was Joe (I thought), but I couldn't remember his last name.  Among other things, he checked the guys' calendars.  When he left, I was fuming.  I said it was so Mickey Mouse that I was surprised the guys would stand for it, and if they had any guts they would burn the place down.  He agreed.  I mentioned that I had a Playboy calendar in my carrel at the library and that no one had ever said anything to me about it-although I began to wonder then if it was just a matter of time before they did.  I decided to go back to my room, but had a hard time catching Minnie.  \"Joe\" went in his bathroom and sat down on the toilet.  Minnie started to follow him in.  I didn't want to go in and interrupt his privacy by struggling with two cats, so I reached in from outside and got her with some difficulty by putting my hand under her belly and lifting her.  It occurred to me, as if in anticipation of a question from him, that it was odd that I could pick Tonya up by the back of the neck, but not Minnie, who seemed to have more loose skin.  When I got out in the hall, Betita Johansen was there, anxiously looking for Bertrand Therber, who was late for an appointment."

I don't know how the arrangements came about, but I felt a bit guilty about letting the Archlands sleep back there on a less comfortable bed, since they were our guests.  It didn't make me feel bad enough to offer to trade with them, though.  I thought it would be too obviously an afterthought-and besides, I liked the idea of sharing a bed with Roxanna.  She and Dick went to tell the Archlands goodnight.  Then they came back and got in bed with us.  Dick kissed Bonita goodnight, and I kissed Roxanna.  Bonita's kiss was a simple goodnight kiss, but when I kissed Roxanna, she opened her mouth, I opened mine, and we drank each other deeply inside.  At that point, I was really looking forward to the night.  The only thing to hamper my enjoyment of the kiss, and my anticipation, was wondering what Bonita would think."

I started winding them up to get them all going at once, but there were too many, and the first had always run down by the time the last one was wound.  It was quite a sight nevertheless.

        "dream_content": "I was on an upstairs floor of a department store.  Sharon Ferguson was in the vicinity.  Somehow we got the word that there was a fire in the building-downstairs, so we couldn't get out.  Everyone was told to keep as low to the floor as possible, to avoid smoke inhalation.  So everyone sat down on the floor, not seeing much smoke and expecting the sprinkler system to start at any moment.  The floor we were on was empty, like a warehouse.  When I finally left that building, I was with Henry Kissinger and a couple of other guys, whom I knew but don't remember now.  We were going somewhere with several other people, but I chose to go with this group so that I could write home and say I had ridden with Kissinger.  When I got to their car, they were already in it -- two in the front seat and two in the back -- of a Karman Ghia.  I was disappointed and said I had better ride with someone else.  They said I could squeeze in for the short ride, though, so I piled in on top of someone in what I thought was the back seat but turned out to be the front when we drove away.  I think Gaylen Tuttleson was driving.With this group or possibly another (the transition is hazy), I arrived at a building where some sort of military conference was to take place.  The building was at the top of a long and fairly high incline.  Those with me went up ahead of me without much trouble.  One of them was Ron Nadner, and I thought, \"Surely if he can make it, so can I.\"  But my legs failed me.  I tried crawling, but had to depend on my arms to pull me along, and pretty soon they too gave out.  One of the guys who had gone up ahead of me taunted me by crawling back down past me to the bottom, then back up past me again.  Somehow I finally made it by getting off that main track and going up alongside it-or alternating between the two, I'm not sure.When we got into the hall, there was a big meeting in progress.  I stopped in the foyer and was talking to some of the guys there.  We could see the audience through glass windows and open doors.  I guess I was talking too loud and had to be shushed.  Bob McNamara was one of the guys in the foyer, as was Rick Klaustermann.  I had on a khaki uniform, and all of a sudden noticed that instead of my captain's bars, I had on subdued (fatigue-type) insignia.  And one of them, part of a clasp, was missing or dangling loosely.  Somehow I was able to figure out how it was that I had those insignia, but I felt I shouldn't be wearing them there.  There was another problem:  my beard-which no one had seemed to notice.  I asked a couple of people about these problems, but no one seemed interested.  One guy, not in uniform, suggested I pick up the captain's bars at the PX.  But I told him I wasn't on active duty and didn't have an ID card.  It seemed that everyone around was in one or another secret outfit."

As before, we suspected that something was wrong some time before the official notification.  Water was almost to the edge of the decks when the order came over the PA system:  \"Lower the lifeboats, Congressmen.\"  I didn't know whether that meant they were supposed to do the work or to be the first ones aboard.  I assumed the latter, which sort of irritated me.  Actually, though, everyone pitched in to lower them, and children were the first ones put aboard.  The lifeboats were very small -- not much bigger than a bathtub -- and it took so long to lower them that I began trying to figure out what we should do if we found ourselves in the water.  I had a hand in lowering one boat.  It was actually pulled by a rope along a sort of wire frame or net along the side of the boat until it got to the desired location.  A young girl or boy got it started, to my left, and I passed it on to a group of women and children to my right.Again the transition is hazy.  We might have gone right over the edge on to dry land.  At any rate, we found ourselves in a yard sort of like Grandpa's back yard except larger, and bounded by woods rather than fence, and there was a group of elephants coming through a gate (maybe there was a fence after all.).  There were two or three very cute small ones and a half dozen or more adults.  While we were watching them in amazement at how close we could come to them (I even considered trying to \"kidnap\" one of the babies, but was prevented from getting too close by a mother who kept pushing me away with the end of her trunk), my daughter Christina wandered in among them.  I was horrified when I noticed, because although they seemed docile enough, I knew they could accidentally step on her.  But every time I tried to get through to her, they blocked my way threateningly, as if protecting their own young ones.  I gasped in horror as one started to lie down near Christina and almost lay right on top of her.  Fortunately, though, it was somewhat immobilized as a result, and I was able to rush up and snatch her away."

It was night, and he stopped at a garage to have something checked.  I guess I went somewhere else for a while, because I remember coming back and hoping the car was ready to go.  Instead, he said that the car had a rear wheel bearing that was on the verge of breaking, and they didn't know if they had the part to fix it that night.  I was disappointed.  The guy who drove it into the garage seemed to suddenly remember the possibility that they did have the part after all, but I don't remember what came of it.Not clear whether this was part of the same dream or another dream.  Again I was in my car, but this time with my wife Bonita and my daughter Christina.  We had stopped for gas, and I had gone into the restroom.  When I urinated, it came out horizontally and hit a door or something.  Before I finished, I was absentmindedly standing in front of an open door still doing it before noticing what I was doing.  Before I returned to the car I ran into a guy with a slight Spanish accent who asked me if I was a Democrat.  I said yes, and he asked me if we had left a light on in our apartment.  He pointed to one burning in the apartment complex behind us.  I told him it wasn't ours.  These apartments were like the ones Bonita and I lived in when we were first married, except that the ones where the light was burning were painted solid white, and the row between us and them were pale green.  I wondered what this light had to do with whether I was a Democrat.  I decided he had just recognized me from having seen me at a Democratic meeting of some kind which it seemed I had attended earlier.  Still, it seemed an odd way to bring up the subject.When we got back to the car, I had Christina with me, and Bonita thanked me for taking her to the bathroom with me, changing her diapers, or whatever I did.  We put her in the back seat and started out again.  Then I realized that I hadn't strapped her in, and we had to stop and do that.  I was frustrated, because it seemed we had had several delays already, and since we were going on a long trip (to my hometown, I think), it seemed it was going to take us three or four days instead of one."

The elevator rose at an angle, like the funiculaire in Quebec.  A couple of people asked me what kind of work I did.  I just smiled and reminded them, \"No classified talk in elevators,\" while at the same time hoping to distract them from noticing that I had no badge.  On one floor there was a glass or wire mesh-enclosed room with a slightly raised floor.  Inside were several women nude at least to the waist.  Their breasts were of different sizes and pendulousness.  I went up to them, thinking if they didn't make an embarrassed effort to cover themselves, it was an open invitation to something or other.  But they didn't seem interested.  There was one other woman, on a bed just outside the room, and she seemed more willing, but I don't remember what came of it.Later I was talking to some guy sitting on a bench on the first floor.  He had noticed that I didn't have a badge.  I was trying to talk my way out of it by telling him I often dreamed about being there without my badge, and how did I know I wasn't dreaming now?  Of course I knew that was ridiculous, because I knew I wasn't dreaming.  But I thought that would only confuse him.I ended up staying late, and was responsible for something or other, and when I was outside the gates Rob and Fay Hunter were going to give me a ride home.  But first I had to stop at some supply shed in connection with whatever my responsibility was-some equipment or money or something.  The guy there asked me if I had any sports equipment, etc., and I said no, and then he checked and found he had \"the dollar,\" so everything was OK-even though I was sure I hadn't given him anything.  The next day I think I decided not to go to work, and I worried about getting into trouble."

I asked about Keith, and she said that he was fine and was no longer in the ministry-which didn't surprise me.  We were going to play a softball game, and either before we left work or at the playing field, Joey Brownell read the lineup.  I expected to be near the top, but kept waiting for my name and was terribly disappointed to find that I wasn't in the lineup at all.  I was also embarrassed, because Janine was there and made some comment about my not being in the lineup, and I told her I didn't understand it because I played every inning of every game last year.Later, the agency crowd was at Norma Grimson's house for a lawn party or something.  I went out to the garage to set up the croquet set, and Janine went with me.  Apparently we found a lot to talk about.

So I did, but I didn't like the possibility that the suspicion might fall on Nancy.  Fortunately, the other kid was such a brat that I think there could have been little doubt who did it.Nancy and I were downstairs with our friends Paul and Steve.  There were a couple of sets of really tall bunk beds and some things I don't remember hanging on the walls-model airplanes or something.  I noticed the windows were dirty and considered cleaning them, but decided that wouldn't be polite either.  Besides, some were dirty screens and the outsides of storm windows.  We must have been upstairs instead of downstairs, because Nancy got out on the ledge of an open window, and it was at least three stories high.  Suddenly she started to fall.  I gasped and leaped up and grabbed her hand.  That was all I had her by, but little by little I managed to drag her inside.  In doing so, she dragged against the latch and got scratched, but I kept telling her not to worry about getting scratched, just to concentrate on holding my hand.  I was so relieved to have saved her that I held her like I would my daughter Christina, and when someone asked me about it, I started crying.

The Lingermans were already backing their VW out of the driveway, and they very sarcastically, for some reason, quoted what I had earlier written or told them, that I would spend that week in my hometown \"visiting relatives.\"  Maybe they were sarcastic because what I had just told them sounded like a feeble excuse to get away, while I had already told them before that it was legitimate.

He commented on the books I had, and I told him I had been looking for Teilhard de Chardin."

My daughter Christina was with me, and I used her as bait to attract Jane Fonda, who was at the restaurant, not as herself, but playing the part of a pick-up.  We were at tables at an outside patio.  Later, I was sitting in a car with Jane Fonda, who had put a loaded pistol under some newspapers or clothes on the back seat.  I asked her if it wouldn't be better to have it in the glove compartment, where she could get to it more quickly if she needed it.  She said she was afraid it would go off when we went over a bump or something.  Just then a little Japanese guy with a gun came sneaking around the front of the car to her side (the passenger side) to mine.  He was going to kill us for some reason.  The door on my side was open, and when he came around it to shoot us, I got the gun off the back seat and fired it behind my back, behind the seat, through the open front door, and killed him instantly.  He hadn't even fired his gun yet, so at first I tried to make his finger pull the trigger of his gun, so that I could claim self-defense more convincingly.  When I couldn't do it right away, however, I decided it would be too obvious, with the length of time between the two shots.  The restaurant owner had seen the whole thing, and I felt I could count on him to support me, though I wasn't absolutely sure."

I went in a back room sort of like the living quarters of Grandpa and Grandma's old store, except it was a large public restroom.  I had to take a crap, and there were several toilets, but only one was enclosed, and it was occupied by the director.  I didn't want to take a crap out in the open like that, but I didn't want to hang around waiting outside the closed one either.  So, since there was no one else in there anyway, I made for an open one, even though the director at that moment came out of his.  I don't know how it came about, but in a very short while there were lots of people in there-mostly women and children.  There were two black girls about college age in front of me and to my right, and they were discussing what a hard time they were having taking a crap because they felt inhibited -- that is, they couldn't convince themselves that they were really on a toilet and that they wouldn't crap in their pants or something -- which was exactly the way I felt.  I sat there for quite a while, and actually did something, too, but I didn't want to get up and wipe myself with all those people around.  There were a couple of pairs of rather dirty diapers on the floor in front of me, and a couple of the kids (little girls all, I think) were marvelling that I still wore them.  I was embarrassed-I didn't think I still wore them either, but I couldn't figure out any other explanation for them.  I thought about wiping myself with them when I got up, as if to suggest that that is what they were there for-but I decided that that wouldn't be convincing, since they were already soiled.  Finally I got up and pulled my pants up without wiping, and began to rinse out the diapers.  I was afraid the people would think I was really disgusting for not wiping, but I decided that that was better than wiping in front of them.  I waited at least until the crowd had thinned out, and then I wiped myself-once.Meanwhile, across from me was a sort of old-fashioned kitchen, and a cute girl whom I knew, but not very well, had been in there preparing a meal or something almost the whole time.  When I finally got my pants pulled back up for good, I walked across to the kitchen, thinking I would put my arm around her and kiss her.  She was quite a bit younger than I.  When I got in the kitchen, I saw that she had been joined by a couple of other girls I also knew, and they were lounging on a bed which was in the opposite end of the room which served as a kitchen, in front of a window.  The girl herself was on a chair beside the bed.  I was disappointed that she wasn't alone, because I felt inhibited about kissing her in front of those girls."

A dumpy woman with a Spanish accent and big, black eyes was scurrying around looking for the \"linen room.\"  I asked someone and found out it was across the front lawn from the building.  I pointed it out to her without being able actually to pick it out specifically myself.  She set out for it, walking along the sidewalk, and I watched her big rear end bobbing up and down-first one buttock and then the other.  She was grotesquely broad in the rump, but I must have been really horny, because I was attracted to her.  When I left the building, another young military officer was with me-and two girls, one of whom was his girlfriend.  We passed another group of uniformed men as we walked, and none of them saluted, but this lieutenant saluted them, and turned as they passed, holding his salute.  I don't know whether they outranked us and he was being ultra-deferential, or whether they should have saluted us, and he was reminding them of that sarcastically.  I suspected the latter.Both girls were attractive.  I couldn't seem to get anything going with the free one, but when the lieutenant and his girlfriend had some kind of falling out, she began to walk with me, ahead of the other two, and was quite friendly.  Next I remember we were in the upstairs bedroom of a house or apartment.  It was more like an attic apartment; there was a stairway to downstairs, but there was also a direct access to the apartment from the outside via a fire escape-type stairway.  The room had a screen or partition in the middle, with the bed on the opposite side of it from the outside wall.  I was sitting on the bed, and she was doing something.  I was trying to get up my nerve to make advances toward her, and was trembling by the time I finally reached out and touched the smooth back of her neck and her long blonde hair.  She moved away, but only to go lock the door to the outside and lower the blinds.  The next thing I remember is waking up next to her the next morning.  There were voices downstairs.  One was her boyfriend.  I had the impression she was going to use me to make him jealous, but I didn't mind."

I was surprised she took that sitting down.  Down another corridor we came to a lot of people standing around drinking.  One of the men looked very much like Charlie Sanders.  He got sick and threw up twice in a corner.  Whether for that reason or some other, I was infuriated.  I would have hit him except for the fact that he was so sick.  Instead, I spit in his face.  Twice.  He must have been penitent for some reason, because he said he understood how I felt, and thanked me for not hitting him in the stomach.  Later on I was talking to Randy Allenson about it on the phone, and I asked him to guess who was involved-and Charlie Sanders was the first name he guessed."

He then turned to me and told me, in effect, that the same thing would happen to me if I reported the incident.  I pretended to be intimidated, but secretly was making careful mental notes of his description so that I could inform the police when I thought it was safe to do so.  The dream had an intricate plot which I don't remember, and involved a lot of this sort of violence."

The guy's name was on the door, followed by the word \"Sheriff.\"  When he saw us come in, he started ranting and raving about that being a \"white man's house\" (apparently in contrast to Indians).  Later on, he began dropping bigoted remarks about blacks too, and I was really mad and wanted to leave.  He said they had already ordered a sign for the place, so weren't interested in hers, but I didn't want to give up that easily, so I had to put up with his bigotry for a while even though it made me sick.

She kept doing things like putting her head on my shoulder, putting her arm around me, etc.-all for Mary's benefit, I was sure.

When I got to our neighborhood, which was single-family houses, I noticed Mr. Kramer (the tenant below our apartment, who just moved out) in front of the house next door, along with a couple of other men.  They were red-faced and extremely agitated, jumping up and down, shouting, gesticulating at me, and waving boards.  When I stopped, just beyond them, they came rushing up and started flailing at me with boards, some of which contained nails.  I was really mad and almost hit Kramer with a big rock or piece of metal nearby, but I was afraid I would kill him, so I just tried to fend off the blows.  He finally revealed that five dead bodies had been found in my apartment, or our building, and I guess he suspected me.  My immediate thought was for my wife Bonita and my daughter Christina.  I ran into the building screaming and crying, going from room to room.  The rooms were empty except for big piles of used kitty litter in each room.  Beth Hooper was there.  There were no dead bodies, but I was very upset at not finding Bonita and Christina.  To my great relief, I finally found Christina walking around-naked--but I never did find Bonita."

They had another guest, and to my infinite amazement, his first name was Gilbert, and his middle name was the same as my last name.

I asked him where his middle name came from, and he started telling about his father being from the north, but I don't remember anymore than that.   We all went outside, along with Wayne and Joyce, to play some game or have some other kind of activity.  Either as part of the activity or because I didn't think much of it, I was lying on the top bunk of bunk beds, in the middle of the street.  It was night, and I have the impression the street was like the one in Paris which runs along the Seine near the hotel where we stayed.   There was a fierce battle going on, though whether real or staged, I'm not sure.  There were massive waves of attacking infantry all around right there on the street, bullets flying everywhere, dozens of men being cut down, screaming with blood-curdling realism.  When it all died down, I decided I had had enough of this \"game,\" so I started to get up and go inside.  I was naked, though, or had on pajamas or underwear at the most, so I hesitated a while longer.  When I did get out from under the cover and get up, there was a woman on the street who wore glasses (I think), was attractive, and wore a green print dress that was loose, filmy, and seductive.  Somehow I propositioned her, perhaps only implicitly by standing before her in a semi-nude state, but she stalked away.She entered a building, and shortly thereafter a light came on in a room on the first floor, street side.  Through the window I could see either her or another woman come into the room, followed shortly by an older woman with silver hair.  The first woman walked directly to the window, and I thought sure she would lower the blinds, but she didn't, and I'm sure she could see me outside.  I went into the same building, and I met the older woman in the hall.  She was pimping for the younger one.  She wanted to introduce me to the younger one, whom she described as a \"secretary.\"  When the \"secretary\" came to the door, the older lady asked me, \"Isn't she attractive?\"  She wasn't very, but she wasn't ugly either.  She wore glasses, had light-colored eyes and vacant features, with short, disheveled dishwater-blonde hair.  She stood in the doorway, silent and expressionless.  One or the other invited me in.  But my wife Bonita was upstairs in Norman and Sheila's apartment, and I felt she was expecting me.  It was Monday.  I told the women I couldn't do it today, but I would be back.  Then I went upstairs.  Later on I came back by that apartment.  There were some other people there-clients, I imagine.  For some reason, I gave the older woman some money, and she was very put out because it wasn't enough."

I thought that was ridiculous, but he wouldn't let me pass without it, so I had to go back.  I ended up somewhere outside, though, and on my way back to the building I met a girl (Annie Soule, maybe) who had just gotten off the subway and was also going to join the group going on the trip.  She said it was already 8:10.  I was shocked.. I looked at my watch and it said 8:55-which, strangely enough, did not prove to me that it was even later than she said, but that my watch had stopped, since that was the time it read when I tried to go to the bathroom, and therefore that was why I was late.  I thought there was barely an outside possibility that I could still make it, but I felt like polio was setting in my legs-they were very stiff, and ached badly, and sometimes collapsed.  She walked with me, though, along the base of an elevated railway.  We reached a building and had to climb the fire escape.  We reached about the fifth floor and she stepped off the edge.  Without a sound, she plummeted to the concrete below.  I couldn't bear to look, and was paralyzed by a state of abject terror.  I collapsed on the spot-a small corner of the fire escape at the corner of the building.  I was scared to move, and for some time I couldn't even utter a sound.  Then I began to cautiously (as if too loud a sound would cause me to fall) to call out hoarsely, \"Adam.  Eve.\"  Gradually louder.  Soon I was sure that I must have made someone aware of my presence; I could hear voices around the corner.  I was hoping they would send the fire department to rescue me so I could keep my eyes tightly closed and just lie there.  But they didn't.  Apparently they thought I was planning to jump, and they handed my daughter Christina to me around the corner to discourage me from it.  This was the last thing I needed, and I was more horrified than ever.  I began shouting at them to take her back, and then screaming hysterically.

I looked around the class and saw there were three or four black students, so I asked one of them to volunteer to explain why (or whether) it makes a difference to them if they are called blacks or Negroes.  A cute little boy with an Afro, and slightly gap-toothed, volunteered.  He was sitting at the left end of the cross table.  He was very articulate, intelligent, and precise in his pronunciation, though he used the word \"apprehensiveness\" in a context which struck me as slightly inappropriate.  I don't remember the substance of his explanation, but it was good.  I then lectured about a related point dealing with language, which was a slight digression, and then the period ended.  I felt very good -- confident, organized, and articulate -- and both Will Halliston and Mrs. King complimented me after the class on doing a good job.Then I was teaching a sophomore English class-probably at a traditionally black college, since all the students were black.  Again, the class had been going well, but I had been dealing mainly with grammar for several weeks and suddenly realized I hadn't given them a single composition assignment.  So just as the class ended, I assigned them to write one, due in about a week.  It was close to the Easter holidays, and I tried to arrange it so that it wouldn't be due the first meeting after the holidays.  It was to be four pages if handwritten, two if typed.  Try as I might, I couldn't think of a topic, so I left it up to them.  The reaction to this assignment, though, shocked me.  They were outraged.  They gave all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't have such an assignment, including the fact that some just \"didn't like to write compositions.\"  The outcry was so unanimous that I agreed to discuss it with the head of the department.  (I didn't know his name, so I must have been a substitute, or new in the department.)  I was angry with myself for this floundering, and was afraid I wouldn't be able to regain their respect.

        "dream_content": "I was at the edge of the street in front of Grandpa's house in my hometown.  There were kids playing all up and down the street -- some of them in the street -- and quite a few people in their yards.  It was just about dusk.  To my horror, a car came around the corner and struck a little girl about 2 years old, who was playing in the street in front of the Creagers' house.  It hit her just hard enough to knock her down so her head hit the pavement.  I felt awful-I couldn't even bear to go see how the little girl was, for fear she might be dead.  Then a car came along at a faster speed and straddled another little girl who was lying down in the street.  I held my breath and hoped the underside of the car would clear her.  Again I was horrified to see that she had disappeared when the car had passed.  She was carried somehow all the way to the end of the block, and there she came loose.  Even though it was almost dark, I could see her fall, and hear the sickening thumps as she hit the pavement and the car ran over her.  I was practically hysterical; I ran into the street in the paths of other oncoming cars, to stop them and tell them to slow down.  I never did stop them, though, because I was too afraid to stay in front of them-the most I could do was slow them down a little bit, then yell at the driver to slow down because two little girls had already been hit.  Of course the cars had passed before I could get that all out; they didn't seem to pay much attention to me, and I found I couldn't shout very loudly.  A very tall fellow, apparently a church acquaintance, possibly Joe Short, arrived on the scene and asked me if he could give me \"any support.\"  He kept asking me this, and although we certainly needed help slowing down the cars, I was reluctant to ask him for any favors for fear he had ulterior motives, being associated with the church.  I went into Grandpa's house and into a bedroom-either to see how one of the little girls was or to talk to someone who was in bed there.  The church guy followed me, as did two little neighbor girls, one of whom was Beth Hooper.  The other one was about her age.  One of them kept talking to me about astronauts, and the other (Beth, I think) about one she had met who was an admitted homosexual.  I finally got annoyed at listening to them, since I had the fate of these other two little girls on my mind, so I told them politely that I would talk to them later about astronauts.  When I went back outside, several barriers had been set up in the intersection.  They were painted with red chevrons and flooded with light.  They didn't block the street entirely, but at least they served as an efficient speed breaker."

        "dream_content": "I was at something like college registration, only it occurred at the end of a school year.  As I came to the building in which it was held, it was late at night, but there was a big mob moving through the door, merging into some semblance of a line inside.  I recognized a lot of people from either my alma mater or high school, including Helen Gamble of the former group, and Anne Panelli and Nanlee Briggs of the latter.  I got in line behind Anne.  I decided that the big rush was because the time was just at the curfew hour (1:45 a.m. or 2:45 a.m.) and everyone was just returning from dates, etc.  I could have kicked myself for picking such a bad time.  As I got to the window or counter where the necessary transaction was to take place, I saw Jim Wheeler first in line.  I was really excited, since I had wondered for so long how to get in touch with him.  When I spoke to him, he seemed pleased to see me, but not overly surprised.  He was having a bit of trouble with the registration procedure.  It seemed you needed a card with your social security number on it, plus the names and SSNs of two other people.  I told him my SSN so that he could use it, and I noticed how badly his hand shook when he wrote it down; he was extremely nervous.  I wanted to visit with him, but decided it was better to finish the procedure and get out of that madhouse first.  I couldn't find my card, though, and when I tried to get someone behind the counter to help me, they always moved over and waited on someone else.  I was getting really mad, and finally started complaining to one of the employees who was not waiting on anyone.  He asked me to lower my voice.  I told him I had been waiting there longer than anyone else who was now being waited on.  Also, to my surprise and dismay, Jim was gone, and I didn't know how to locate him again.  I finally succeeded in getting a battered, faded card as a replacement for mine.  It had one other SSN on it, which looked like what I remembered Jim's to be.  Part of it was faded out, but I was able to reconstruct it from memory.  The last four digits, I think, were 1562.  By that time, though, everyone else had gone, and there was no one to get another number from.  I was infuriated, and told them so.  I said it was stupid to have to have two other SSNs, and I didn't see how the university where I work could have such a speedy and efficient registration system and then have this thing so loused up.  By this time it was beyond their closing time, and they acted like they were doing me a favor just talking to me."

        "dream_content": "I was driving -- with my wife Bonita, I guess -- either northwest (towards town) on Hill Road near the library.  On the right ahead was a new Howard Johnson's.  First, though, there were twin restaurants, of the franchise kiosk-style type, on either side of a parking lot.  Each one had a carhop with an enormous papier-mâché head of a horse or donkey, which made them almost as big as the kiosk itself.  The Howard Johnson restaurant, on the other hand, was mounted about halfway up a tower of about three or four stories in height.  The restaurant was round, considerably exceeded the tower in diameter, and slowly revolved.  For some reason, I felt compelled to ridicule the idea and the people eating there.  Actually, though, I thought it would be a good way to get a panoramic view of the surrounding area.  We went into a restaurant, but it wasn't that one.  It reminds me of the place we ate lunch in Paris just before leaving-rather stark, with dark brown benches.  There were a couple of very pregnant women sitting on benches, and a couple of others came in while we were there.  They were unmarried and were talking about having abortions-apparently that's what they were there at the \"restaurant\" for.  They were a little embarrassed, but not much, and rather cheerful, I thought.  I was shocked at the thought of their having abortions so late in their pregnancies."

I made a practice run from Dallas to my hometown, with my wife Bonita monitoring my progress on the ground.  I considered carrying her on my back as I flew, but thought it might make me too heavy, so she walked or drove.  I attained fantastic speed-faster than I had ever flown before, faster even than jet planes.  It was so fast that I was worried about my landing.  I tried to pick out a spot where it had been raining, so the ground would be soft.  I was successful in finding such a place, surrounded by green hills, and grabbed some tree limbs on my way down to help break my fall.  It was a pretty smooth landing.   Somewhere after that we met Evie Marche and I told her of my plans.  She didn't seem to understand too well.  Later on we were at Mother's house and were watching Warner Wolf on TV.  Then Warner was there in the living room with us, and I was telling him of my plans.  I suggested he announce it on his show sometime.  The living room was much narrower than Mother's, and a mirror image of it as far as arrangement is concerned.  When it came time to eat, Gaylen Tuttleson was there, or else Warner became Galen, and he wanted to look through Mother's books on either side of the fireplace.  I was pleased that there were so many good ones, and I was late getting to the table because of pointing them out to him."

Whether it came first or second, I'm not sure, but one episode found John and me and Ellen Wall lying in his back yard at night when a huge dirt clod in the form of a cloud whose shape rather resembled Austria floated by directly overhead.  It filled me with a sense of foreboding, and I suggested we run for the house.  Just as we did, it began to break up, and the dirt began to fall, spattering a couple of houses behind John's the hardest, but a little fell in his yard as well.  Not much hit us, though.  John and Ellen jumped into a small pit in the yard, and I followed close behind them.  When it was over, we went to the houses which had been hardest hit, and they were a horrible sight-the entire upper story of one completely destroyed, and the other badly damaged.  The owners were surveying the damage; one of them was a carpenter or architect.  The two houses were connected in the front by a wall, and the carpenter was explaining where they could put joists to provide mutual support for the two houses.  I didn't know for sure what a joist was, and I didn't understand his plan at all.In the other part associated with John, I was in their house, and we were getting ready to go out.  I was in the bathroom, wondering what towel to use.  There were several sets hanging in a very fancy arrangement, but they were all alike.  I was going to ask Lois, but I was in my underwear and wasn't sure it was proper.  Anyway, I couldn't find my way around in the house very well.  The bathroom was large and L-shaped, and when I came to another one I actually thought it was the same one, except that I found by peeking through a door that it was adjacent to their bedroom, where they were getting ready.  When we finally all got ready, I asked Lois what she thought about the \"dirt-fall,\" and she knew nothing about it.We were going out to some favorite night spot of John's, but they were taking the kids along.  Lisa was still being carried -- in a blanket, though I thought it was a bit warm for that -- and her face was pudgy and wrinkled.  We set out walking with several other people.  Lois warned me that this place was frequented by \"John's type of people,\" and that she bet I wouldn't like them.  We walked and walked and walked down a busy street and passed several night spots.  I went in a couple of places where a bunch of tough-looking hillbillies were playing slot machines.  I apparently thought they were the right places, but they weren't, and I fell behind the group.  We walked so far, though, that we all got strung out, and occasionally people from the front of the group would have to stop and wait for us or send someone back to direct us.  They all had on yellow slickers, like kids' raincoats, so they were easy to spot -- but we were hopelessly strung out, and the walk went on for so long, that I felt they couldn't possibly know where they were going -- that if they had known it to be that far, they certainly wouldn't have set out to walk it.There was also an short episode in which I looked at a sleeping person or baby, possibly Lisa, and she opened her eyes slowly, until they were just narrow, angular slits, like a cat, and smiled, baring fangs.  I woke up in fear and drew closer to Bonita."

When I left the dorm, I was with a girl, but not the same one.  At first, she was a blonde, with a lot of hair piled on top of her head and a lot hanging down-a wig, I suppose.  It was so striking that at first I thought I liked it-but when I was about to tell her so, I wasn't so sure.  We were going like from the dorms to the university cafeteria.

My car was parked some distance from the party, so I got a ride with my wife Bonita in a VW bus.  I remember parking on the opposite side (from the party) of a school, but she let me out on the near side, which meant I would have to run all the way to the other side, so I asked her if she would drive me around there.  It plainly irritated her, and by the time she let me out on the other side, we were hardly on speaking terms at all.  I looked up and down the street for a red VW convertible (my sister Nancy's car), but to my frustration all I could see were red Fiats, and a few other cars.I thought I should call the station and page Daddy to let him know I was on my way-then I realized I would have to call both Trailways and Greyhound, because I didn't know which terminal he was coming into.The next two parts seem unrelated at first, but later tie in with the same dream.  I was riding a bus, standing up, with Bill Clay and Paul Savage.  I was going to introduce Paul to Bill, but introduced him as \"Bill\" and couldn't think of his last name.  They were passing out paychecks and tried to give me one made out to Herbert Neese, but I protested that it wasn't mine.  They kept insisting, though, so I took it, and then I noticed that Herbert had already endorsed it, as had someone else.  And the check was for somewhere in the neighborhood of $2000.  I didn't know whether I should try to cash it or what.  I arrived at an airport just in time to catch a plane.  This definitely had something to do with meeting the deadline imposed by meeting Daddy's bus-either I was flying to meet the bus or the plane departure time was the same as Daddy's arrival time, or I was going to call him from the airport and didn't have time, or some other scenario."

Someone else at the bottom with me foretold somehow that she would fall, when only 10 inches from the bottom, and be killed.

At one point, Bill Clay came out of the building into the courtyard and several people rushed up to him to tell him about my shenanigans.

I was standing at the exchange window while I was studying the maps, so I frantically began to try to figure out the exchange system, thinking it would be better, if possible, to exchange on a coin-for-coin basis.  There were several types of Russian coins on display there, but some were in kopecks and some were something else, besides being in different amounts.  There were also a lot of coins, including American ones, lying on the floor in front of the counter where people had evidently dropped them, and I couldn't resist wasting my precious time by picking some up.  We finally decided we had better get on the train before it left, even if we weren't sure it was the right one.  After we got on, I began trying to think of how to ask someone how to get where we wanted to go.  But I couldn't think of the word for \"station,\" nor the word and correct aspect for \"go\" in this case.

The \"kits\" were just about the size of a matchbook, yellow, and had printed instructions for how to heighten the sensuality of your experience.  The first girl I saw who had one was in a building much like one at the university where I work.  I had hoped to be more selective, but I didn't know how likely it was that I would run into another anytime soon, and besides, this girl was rather forward.  She took the initiative, and I was reluctant to turn her down.  The room was rather dark, and I met her as she descended a staircase.  As we walked, we passed through a little more light, and I saw that she was not too attractive-she had pimples, and a large mouth.  We passed a couple of full length mirrors like the kind in the clothing departments of stores, but only double-faceted rather than several.  She suggested we make it in front of one of those-but for some reason it didn't seem worthwhile to me because there were only two faces.  We passed through a set of double glass doors and came to another darkened stairway.  She suggested that we do it there.  She was eager."

A very attractive black girl came in with another girl, white, and stood very close to me.  She was in physical contact with me somehow, either affectionately or accidentally.  Soon, though, they left and headed for the elevator.  Suddenly I had the feeling I had been taken, and I grabbed for my billfold.  It was there, but I was already starting after them and shouting to the hotel clerk that I had been robbed as I looked inside.  Sure enough, I found only $2, where before I had had about $50.  They had already gone up on an elevator.  I started to go up another one, but decided it would be best for me to wait until they came down or send someone up to search for them while I waited.  After a while I looked up and saw them calmly sitting in a mezzanine coffee shop over the lobby.  I ran up there and they jumped up and ran for the stairs.  The other girl was my sister Nancy.  I caught one or the other of them and threatened to bash her head in with a glass ashtray I had picked up.  I don't remember whether that was before or after I had chased her downstairs, or what happened to the other one.  In the chase I would go halfway down a flight of stairs, then vault the banisters onto the next flight.  The girl I was chasing did the same thing, though, and I gradually lost ground on her.  I was shocked and upset that Nancy was involved, and I couldn't get her to tell me why.  Later, I was walking with Mother to my car on a darkened street, and we were talking about it, and she didn't know what to make of it either.  Later, also in Nancy's presence (I think), and outdoors, Jim Duggan appeared, and he either attacked me or I felt threatened by him, and I had to defend myself.  I quickly got the upper hand and had him draped backwards over the back of a park bench.  Maybe Jody was there too.  Sharon Ferguson was somehow involved too, and I went to her house to question her.  Apparently the first time she was busy or going out or something, because I came back a second time, hoping to see her mother, whom I hadn't seen in a long time.  Their neighborhood was pretty much the one where Nancy was born."

I went as quickly as possible without seeming panicky to a low, sloping retaining wall at the left of the school, climbed that, and headed for home (the townhouse in the previous dream).  There were big shrubs on either side, and it was night-and I saw to my surprise that there was a light on inside.  When I started to put my key in the lock, it began to turn from the inside.

It was summertime, but the weather was fairly cool, and the sky was very overcast and hazy, which was disappointing, because I expected it to be very sunny.  We were taking a completely random and disorganized tour, and kept finding ourselves in shabby industrial sections of towns I had never heard of.  We also had to climb a lot of steep hills in the towns, which was occasionally very difficult and even treacherous.  At times I doubted we could make it, especially coming down, and was reluctant to even try-yet had to get down to get back to the car.  All this time I was carrying my little transistor radio -- hanging on to it with difficulty at times -- and getting some hometown station -- WWXZ or WAXO, I think -- very clearly, to my surprise.  One museum we went into had an American black student working there as a guide.  I asked him how he liked working in Norway, and he didn't seem to be enthused about it.  When we left the country, we were crossing into Turkey, which seemed strange.  There was a long sign overhead at the border, and no highway-just a field.  We were crossing on foot.  The customs officer wanted to see some official sheet of paper which I didn't have.  I told him I had thrown it away and showed him the instructions which suggested to me that it was okay to do so.  I had a great deal of difficulty trying to exchange my money in Turkey-to recognize the different coins, pronounce their names, figure out the rate of exchange, etc.  I finally gave up, reluctantly, trying to pronounce them in Turkish, and started conducting all transactions in English, as I had done in Norway."

He greeted us in Czech, and it sounded very much like the Russian greeting, and I responded somehow.  He was surprised that I spoke Russian, and began to question me in Russian.  We spoke for a short time that way, and then I had to switch to English.  He was very friendly, and poured us all some wine.  Another official raised his glass for a toast, and when he had given it, he flipped his glass sharply with a deft motion, to Husak, who was several feet away.  Although it was still full of wine, Husak caught it, and not a drop was spilled.  The mouth of the glass was even toward his white shirt when he caught it, but he didn't get any on him.  It was an old Czech custom, and they tried to show me how to hold the glass, with two fingers at the top and the little finger at the bottom.  But I couldn't get the knack of the grip.  When we got ready to go, we looked outside and someone decided it was very cold-7° F.  So we bundled up, but it didn't really seem that cold.  We all piled into a VW.  I asked Dr. Lingerman how he planned to go, and he said through Graz and Klagenfurt.

It was strange, because there was no privacy-all the beds were out in the open.  And although it seemed to be the policy to permit couples to share beds, there was a guy who kept coming around checking to see that there was no hanky-panky.  That was frustrating, but apparently I wasn't sure how Frances would react to any advances anyway, so I just lay in such a way that we were touching -- such as by having one of my legs across hers -- but I had to stiffen it in such a way as to prevent its full weight from resting on her.

I shouted as we passed that dueling was illegal.  They looked at me like I was crazy, but I added the observation that the one guy didn't have a second.  That guy then raised his hand in some kind of gesture that I couldn't make out because we were too far away by then.  I raised my hand and gave the peace sign in response.  He then gave his sword a big fling in my direction.  I was sure we were much too far away for it to reach us, but it fell distressingly close.  He came to get it, and I tried to speed up-but when he got it, we were closer to him than before, and he threw it again.  This time it veered like a Frisbee, and I could see it was heading straight for me.  It hit me in the side with considerable force and made a small slit in my side but didn't stick there.  It really didn't hurt that much, but I felt that I was going to die anyway.  I made it to the \"farm,\" which was actually Uncle Jack's house.  I crawled up to the porch, and that's as far as I could make it.  Someone came out to attend to me, and I found I had an enormous bruise all over my right side, hip, and back."

He walked so fast that I couldn't keep up.  Sooner or later I was walking in a lightly wooded area along the bank of a small lake or pond at a military base.  There were a lot of people in the area, walking, and I ran into the same girl who had given me a blow job earlier.  She must have really liked to do it, because she led me to the side of a large tree, pulled down my pants, and began to do it to me again.  We were partially blocked from the view of passers -- by, but not completely -- but it felt so good this time that I really didn't care.

So we were driving down this old dirt road. There was sugar cane on both sides. The story was that we had never been in this place. That an old lady owned this shooting range. We were driving through it, and we parked the car and we heard some shooting, and people were shooting directly over our heads because we were between the firing line and the target. So we turned the car around and we went back and this old dirt, we found ourselves between a high hedge on the left and tall stacks of sugar cane on the right. On the left behind this hedge was a horserace track like Gulfstream Park. The race was in session and there was all kinds of people and noise, cars but on the right hand side of the road. It was complete wilderness, far from civilization. So we went down this road and we came upon another shooting range. We heard that the price to shoot was $10, but we thought that that was a fantastic price. My friend told me that the price to shoot was $10, but I didn't believe him, so we all got out of the car, and we started to shoot with all the rest of the people. This old woman was behind us and she was yelling at us and she said it costs $20 to shoot one round. With this woman was a nun. The nun was dressed in black and white and she didn't say anything. She was just standing with this old woman. When we found out it was $20 to shoot that was the end of the dream. The colors that I remember are black, white, green and brown.

We were all talking, and then we all left, my father and I and my girlfriend all left the house and got in my car. Then the girlfriend and I were going back to the house. I don't remember what we went back for, but after we left my parents off, we went back to this house which was vacant. As I drove up in the driveway, there was a fifty-seven, fifty-six Ford station wagon pushing another '56 Ford station wagon. There was no one in the first station wagon, but there was a man in the second station wagon. As I was just pulling into the driveway, this man pushed this other station wagon up besides my car. He seemed to be mad about something, so I didn't know what it was. He was mad at me, but I don't know what he was made for. So we had a discussion and then I started to get mad, so he said that if I didn't calm down, he would call the police. I still remained in my car so I got madder, and he just left. The other station wagon just seemed to disappear. I don't know what happened to it. In about 5 minutes the police came. Then I told the police--the police came to the outside of the house, and I told the police I didn't do anything. He should call my mother. So the policeman, my girl, and I went inside this house and he called my mother. My father drove my mother to the house, and she went inside and she was in a room with this policeman talking to him. She was in the kitchen, and they were having coffee. I couldn't see them because the door was closed. I seemed to be able to see under the crack of the door. I could see their feet. My girl and I were in this other room and we were in bed. We weren't doing anything. We were just laying there. She had her dress off. We took her dress off and we were laying there. She still had underclothes on. My mother was still talking to this policeman. I don't know what she was saying. Then my girl said I better put my dress back on because you mother's getting ready to come out of the kitchen. The way I could tell she was getting ready to come out was because I could see under the crack of the door. I could see her feet starting to move, and I could see the policeman's feet starting to get up off the chair. Then they came out. We were just sitting there. My mother said everything was alright, and the policeman left. After that my girl and I and my mother went back into the kitchen. The kitchen I remember was very detailed. Everything was built in. It was all French Provincial. The cabinets were French Provincial. The stove was painted white and gold. The floor was white. It was a very elaborate house, duplex, I mean. The living room was very spacious and everything seemed to be white and gold. Then the policeman left, as I said before, and then my mother and my girl and I walked outside the house. My father was there waiting for my mother. Then my mother got in the car with my father, and they left, and then my girl and I left."

We couldn't find a place to swim, so we decided that we'd go to a hotel where I used to work in the summertime, go to the pool. So someone told us to ask for the pool manager because he was a new manager, and I didn't know him. We went to this hotel and we walked around the side of it through the pool. To get to the pool, we entered a sort of lobby and then we went on to a patio. The pool man was at the far end of  the pool and he was vacuuming it, the bottom of it. The pool was extremely dirty. There was algae on the bottom. It was about half full. We went up and asked him about the pool and he immediately started talking about politics, about the presidential nominations and senators and just general political talk. But apparently he told us to go to another hotel, the DeLido Hotel, which was, we could see it from where we stood. It was down the beach. So we talked a little more about politics and then we got ready to leave to go to the DeLido to swim. Around the pool were lounge chairs. They were about half filled with people, but no one was in the pool. It was a very hot day, and as we started to leave, we had to go through two doors, one had a little square window in it. It was a wooden door. The window was about four inches square, and then there was another heavy wooden door. Then we were back in the lobby. As we opened the first door, the pool man kept on talking about politics and we couldn't seem to get him to stop. So we finally had to sort of shut him out in the pool area, so we could get back in the lobby in order to leave. So as we shut the last door, there were political figures in the lobby, politicians and mayors. There were about three of them. They were going to consult with this pool man on some problem that they had. My friend and I thought generally that he was an expert in politics. As we shut the door, the politicians got mad at us because they wanted to go out to speak to him and we were shutting them out. All this time while he was talking, he had a broom. First of all he was vacuuming when we first saw him, then he had a broom in his hand when we left and was sweeping the patio. So as we left he was talking to these politicians, giving them advice, and then we walked out in the big lobby. The lobby was in the back of the hotel instead of the usual lobby which is in front. We walked out to the car, which was my car , but it was a convertible, a white convertible. That's all I can remember."

I started to walk down this road which was a dirt road, and I began to walk and as I began walking, I saw different sights around every turn. The distance that I walked was approximately 50 miles, but the time factor involved was, it only took me about 15 minutes to walk that distance. I was walking at a normal pace but in the dream it only took me 15 minutes to reach approximately 50 miles. Anyway, I began walking and I walked over sort of a causeway, and on the left hand side there was a motel with a swimming pool. I didn't stop at any of these places. I just walked by them and I kept walking and around the next bend, it was like there was water on one side. On the other side. I can't remember what there was. At the next bend there was like a motel with a few boats and a dock and this big giant about 10 feet tall was there. He just looked like a normal man only he was this real big. He didn't say anything. He just looked, and I just kept on walking and I got to a place, the terrain was like a desert. No, it was like the plains out in Kansas, real flat and dry, and I walked thru these plains and it was about half the distance. And I got to a fork in the road, to this crossroad, it was all, as far as I could see, it was just flat plains, and in this crossroad, there was one house on one side, it was a white frame house, and there was another house on another side. There I saw my girl, and my girl was staying with her girlfriend that stayed in one house and her mother lived across the road, not my girl's mother, but my girl's girlfriend's mother lived in the other house across the road, and this girl and her mother haven't seen each other in two years, even though they lived right across the road from each other, because they weren't on speaking terms. So I got mad at my girl for staying at a place like that, and we were standing outside discussing it. I told her why she shouldn't stay there. But nevertheless, I told her I would pick her up the next day. So I began walking back, and it took me a shorter time to walk back than it did to get there, and everything was in unison like the place I saw when I was walking there, the same place I saw when I was walking back, and I walked thru the plain and I saw this motel with the boats with the big giant, and he was sort of standing right in the middle of the road this time, but he didn't say anything, so I just walked around. And I remember I had tennis shoes on and a pair of dungarees and a t-shirt. It was a dirt road, and then I walked back to the place where I saw there was a motel on the right hand side going back. Then I got to a bridge. It was like a bridge crossing a river and it looked like when you get off the 79th St. Causeway bridge and you come into Miami. It greatly resembled that part, and that was the end of the dream. Colors in the dream, there was blue and a lot of green, there was some grey and there was white. A little while ago my girlfriend was talking about staying with another girl, and I saw a movie called America, America, and it sort of resembled this movie in a way. This person in the movie had to walk to his destination something like I was doing."

I went to a place that resembled the buildings around 12th Ave. and 13th St. These are the federal buildings where the jail is and stuff like that. I pulled over on a side street right off 12th Ave. at night, and I was just watching the traffic. I was real close to the Miami River bridge. I came back to the car and found a ticket on the windshield saying that I had parked crooked. When I parked there was no one there, so I didn't know. So I parked at an angle, and didn't know everyone was supposed to parallel park. I was the only car parked at an angle, but this ticket was not written on the regular form of type ticket paper. This was written, I had an old piece of paper laying on the seat, a piece of loose leaf paper, and the ticket was written out on that, and it said to report to a certain place in Coral Gables. I knew there was something wrong because you don't go to Coral Gables for a parking ticket, but I didn't question, I was going to question the matter, so I was going to walk to the jail, to the courthouse where I was and ask them about it first. While I was walking, there was a bus in front of me, a Miami Transit Co. bus, and on this bus a little side door opened, like on the Greyhound bus where the baggage goes. Anyway, there was a side door on it. This Volkswagen 3 unit car. It was made out of all stainless steel or aluminum. It said Volkswagen on it, and it was like a little bus in itself. It had three units on it like three little cars. This thing drove right into the baggage compartment inside it, drove right inside the baggage compartment of the Miami Transit Co. bus. I remember that because it turned right in front of me to drive into the compartment. This is why the compartment was made, for this little other. There was a compartment on the big bug and it was made for this little Volkswagen bus which was about 3 feet high and about 15 feet long. So I saw this and I didn't think much of it because I thought it was something natural and then I went to ask about my ticket. I got up to the steps. It was very confusing inside. They were just letting a whole bunch of prisoners go, and a bunch of bums were just walking outside. So I figured I would just forget about it and go over to the place where I was supposed to go.

I thought that I should break it up, but then I thought that it was probably none of my business and I should just stay out of it. Then as I went over to break up the fight, I remember my little brother standing there saying not to break it up. I remember stopping myself and instead of breaking up the fight, I said a cutting remark to the older boy who was fighting the smaller one, and apparently when I said it, he must have felt ashamed of himself because he quit fighting. I then remember getting on my bicycle and starting to ride away when a sports car pulled up with a girl and a boy in it. This boy was a boy I had seen around the neighborhood before who lived about two blocks away from our house and who I knew only casually but not closely. I remember seeing this girl and boy pull up in this sports and I remember telling .. I remember seeing also a friend of my younger brother's standing there. I remember telling him to watch the girl as she got out of the car to see if she was good-looking and to tell me when they came over to our house ... to tell me when he came over to our house."

While walking along this narrow path, I told the girl to watch out because there was a quicksand pit up ahead. We walked around that, and then when we went a little further, there was this 6 ft. wall on the left, and it had bars like the bars of a cell. There was warm lava coming down the mountain and in order to keep from falling down, we grabbed onto these bars and started going hand over hand to this jail cell. When we got to it, I climbed down to the window that was guarded by bars and I felt kind of guilty because I wasn't in there with them, and I asked if there was anything I can get for them since I was outside. One guy wanted a bottle of wine and told me the exact name of the wine and I remember writing the name on the wall next to the barred up window. Then I retreated from the window and found myself in a 4-walled one-story building with only part of a roof. While walking out of this building I saw some men running at me who were part of an army or something. They were running at me with machine guns because I had been talking with the prisoners. They were shooting the guns. I had a bottle of wine on me for this man, but I don't know where I got it from. The wine turned into a pint bottle of Vodka. I know Vodka was combustible, so I threw it out the window of this 4-walled structure and I figured that the army would keep firing at it with their bullets and it would catch on fire, and it did. It got on fire that which spilled out of the bottle, but the bottle itself didn't catch on fire. One of the men reached over and grabbed the bottle and threw it back into this four-walled structure where I was. Figuring it would go off, I ran outside and found myself in the company of this beautiful young German blond. Apparently she was a ballet dancer or a girl who was interested in gymnastics or something. She was very graceful in her movements and she was showing me certain movements and certain steps and said she could show me these steps better if we would go inside the gym. There was a half-constructed gym, it still had sanded floors and wooded beams supporting the interior of it. We went in and she started showing me these graceful movements and what not."

Just before the train stopped, my buddies got on the engine instead of a passenger car and I yelled to them something like, \"No, you're getting on the wrong car.\" But they had already climbed aboard and I went running towards the other end of the train (looking for a passenger car) while dodging colored porters pushing luggage carts."

I threw down the helmet to my skin diving wet suit and said, \"Five dollars.\" Immediately a boy took it and gave me the $5, which was for renting it). The place we swam at was much like a place we used to go to in Colorado when I was in summer camp. It was a gorge full of deep pools and a lot of fast-moving water. The boy I rented the helmet to was in the place I wanted to go but it was so small, only I could fit. Finally he moved out and I got in. I had my mask on so I was doing some diving.

I tried to show the way the snow looked as it formed little clouds at the lips of the snow banks as it blew. The ones we were seeing were in beautiful pastels of red, green, and blue.

I did a very poor job preparing, but I was sure I would not be called. As it turned out the professor (female) stopped just one person before me.

The little act they had been putting on was just to show me how foolish I would be if I did quit. I said I wouldn't quit until I was not making any money or my school work was hurt. They said okay. But then the manager began talking about my sales record. He said he wanted to see more than the $65 I turned in last week.

Only spike horns, however. Later, I went outside and saw two hunters and told them about the deer. Then a doe came out, and one of the hunters shot it, but only I could see this since it went behind a tree right after he shot. I heard him say, \"I missed,\" and then the next thing I knew, he had hit me in the ankle, but only with a couple pieces of buckshot. I went to a hunting store to get a first aid kit, but ran into a Spanish-speaking saleslady that couldn't understand me. Finally, I got the kit and fixed myself up. I really have no idea what this means. All I can say is that I used to love deer hunting in Vermont, but I never got one. The only time I ever fired the gun was at a spike horn buck--and I was afraid it might be a doe ($300 fine).

My present roommate Tom also came with me. We first met the headmaster and then Tom met a girl he really liked. He talked to her for a while, then we went to our room. There we met another girl--one I went after. My only problem was that I fell asleep talking to her. Tom, however, kept the conversation going. At first I thought he was going to try to take her, but he said he wasn't interested. He still liked the first girl he met best. It almost seems that the rest of the dream was during the next day, Sunday, I think. The first thing that I remember was a boy standing outside my door looking out of a window. He was wondering how to get out of the building without being caught. Tom and I told him to jump out the window (3rd story). That didn't really help him much. We then started talking about the girls. Tom reminded me that I was class #12. He said all I had to do was find out the girls in #11 and I could get any one of them for the date at the end of the day. I went downstairs to find out who was in my classes, but couldn't find the list. I then decided to go outside. At the door there were several boxes of fruit. I said at first that they were a product of Florida, but someone behind me said that they were from Canada. They turned out to be yellow melons which were a little frozen from standing out in the cold. When I went out, the first thing that happened was a tennis ball landed right near me. Even though it was snowing and there was a strong wind, there was a doubles match going on. I threw the ball back, but it didn't go too far. The guys on the court were mad at this, but I just said that I couldn't throw anything with the mittens I had on. The boy who was doing all the talking was one I had known from prep school and he wouldn't accept my reason. The ball came out again and this time I took off my mittens and threw the ball right over the court to show him I could do it. I decided to go home (which was just a stone's throw from the school). Before I left, however, I remember watching some of the boys from the school playing. They were aged from about seven to ten. At home I asked my father what he was going to do. He said he had just got a phone call from one of his friends who opened up a club I belong to. The club is way out in the country and surrounded by some beautiful scenery. My father's friend said that since my father hadn't showed up, he had closed the club. I looked at my watch then and found it was 11:40. I couldn't figure out why dad couldn't have gone earlier. I then remember thinking about the club. I knew it would be cold, etc., but I still would have loved to have gone there. The dream ends here. All through this dream I kept wondering why I had come to the school. I was by far the oldest student. I also wondered what my record was going to look like to an employer."

It seems as if there had been a crime committed and the townspeople were protecting the crooks. Investigators were everywhere and it was my job to guide them around. Several times the underground would act to prevent the authorities from doing anything--like when they were after someone, an empty street was suddenly at the snap of a souie key man's finger, transformed into a maze of blockades, signs and parked cars. Usually there was one car that the investigator was pushed into. He was then driven off to be enlightened by someone, but there was no violence--in fact, it was funny. The scene now shifts. I am in a high priced European car (a black Mercedes, I think) with a sun roof. The car seems to be mine, and so does the house I stop at. A girl is there and apparently I am very fond of her. I cannot remember anything we did, however. Just vaguely I remember getting her a drink--champagne, I think. The scene now shifts again. The girl and I are listening to a radio. We seem older, perhaps married. The announcer is informing us that the country's #1 criminal has died beneath the wheels of a train. I remember that the year was 1939. Now the scene shifts again, this time to a 1939 car. I am thinking how remarkable it would be if the people of that year could see a 1964 car. The whole dream took place at night and the setting was, except for the last scene, was in Europe. I was often among very rich people and was, I guess, rich myself. The people in the dream were almost all older than I--average age was 30."

It could have been photographing the service, but anyway, I was up in front of the congregation. The man who was leading the service (it hadn't begun) said he wanted one more person in the choir. He pointed at me. I had to share a book with two other boys, and I didn't sing bad at all. I even remember the man who sent me up smiling at me as if to say, \"That's good.\" The choir then filed out and went into another room. There was another organ in there, and the director began to have us rehearse. He then announced that we would not be needed for the rest of the service (which was going on in the next room) and we could go. I can then remember a few images of a rather dreary, dull dorm and my room. The scene then changes and goes back to the room we were rehearsing in. A few of us are telling about some injustice which has been done to us. The group splits into two opinions over the matter and tempers flair. It seemed to have something to do with the lights. The group I am in decides we must get to a control room to do something to the lights. We then start running down a long tunnel, but have to fight our way along it because the other group is trying to stop us at all costs. The tunnel was large enough to stand up in and in our point there was a stream running through it. I got the idea that I might be able to carry out the mission if I could run ahead and then unscrew all the light bulbs. I did this and it worked. The tunnel ended in my grandfather's basement. I rushed over to a large switch box with one other boy and we tried to figure which switch it was that controlled all the lights in the school. Finally I just began pushing buttons, but I got the one which opened the garage door. I quickly pushed the next button which closed it, but I was sure it had made enough noise to wake up my grandfather. And I was right because soon I heard some noise upstairs. I remember I took a whole flight of stairs in one leap, got my friend and started for the tunnel. But it was too late. My grandfather was coming down the stairs 4 at a time so I saw I had to speak to him. We explained we weren't trying to steal anything, but just had to do something to the lights. He accepted this. About this time the others all started coming out of the tunnel. One good friend said that I had a good idea when I unscrewed the lights, but that it was a little painful--he was rubbing a bump on his head. Finally, everything turned out fine and we all returned."

The scene now changes and it is daytime and I am on a small motorcycle. I was going to where there was a big crowd and I was thinking something about the gear ratios he had in comparison to those in the cycle. The crowd was gathered around a fight ring. Some boys I knew from prep school were going to fight next--even though they were outclassed. After the fight (I cannot remember it or the outcome) we went to the house of a man and his wife (about 30) for coffee. I think he was a professor, perhaps for prep school."

        "dream_content": "This dream was about a series of things which went on while I was at home in Vermont. The time was in the present, and I had just come home. The first thing I can remember was coming out of a neighbor's house. In the house I vaguely remember talking with a group of people--who I think I knew. I then got an old piano stool and began to ride it down a small hill. After a few trips down I got tired of this and looked over to another neighbor's house. In his yard there was an old racing car. I then took the piano stool, which had somehow changed into something else on four wheels, and tossed it into the pile of antiques I had taken it from. I thought I might have bent one of the wheels, but I didn't take a closer look. I went to this second neighbor's basement (which was open--much like a garage--however, not in actuality) and started looking around then at antiques. There were about three cars there and boxes of other things. I picked up a slot machine which had been used to figure out income tax. It worked this way. You pull the handle to spin the dials. Whatever numbers came up is the amount you pay--unless you hit the jackpot, then you get money. (Wow!) I remember this thing was light and looked as if it had been made in Japan from tin cans. After looking at a few more things, I left. I went home because we were supposed to go with my father to see about getting a new Jeep or Land Rover. My brother was shaving when I reached the bathroom. After he finished, he told me that he had been down to see the Jeep dealer and found that Dad could get a Jeep fully equipped with all the accessories he wanted for the price of the bare land Rover. I told my brother that this wouldn't work on Dad. He had his mind made up on a Rover and it would be almost impossible to change. He agreed with me. I then came into the bathroom as he was finished shaving. I noticed that the toothpaste tube was floating in the toilet bowl. My brother said it had slipped off the sink. My brother then began talking about changing because he wanted to wear an undershirt under the shirt he had on if he was going to see this Jeep dealer. I told him that was foolish. In Florida few students wear them because of the heat. I then remember thinking that it was probably 95 degrees in Miami and clear (it was cloudy and cool at home). He agreed with me, but then looked and found he was wearing one anyway. I then remember cleaning a large plastic tube about _\" in diameter and 10' long. The part I was cleaning was a fitting on one end. It seems somehow that this was part of the razor, but I am not sure. I got a lot of water on the floor from cleaning it as it ran through the tube. I then began to talk to my brother more about the Jeep deal. I said that surely the dealer could offer the price he did for the outfitted Jeep--all he would have to do is to take the stuff off the old Jeep and put it on the new one. The same thing could be done with the Rover. I cannot remember much beyond this. The last scene in my mind before I woke up was something about a hired girl we have living with us and some bunnies she had."

I then started to try to kill the snake. I first grabbed a Budweiser beer bottle and smashed the snake over the head. The bottle didn't break and the snake was still alive. I then had a big shoe brush in my hand. It split in a quarter and finally killed it. Meanwhile there was pain in my foot, real pain that I felt physically. My mother now is there.

They (probably the stage crew) tied it on a stick like they do on safari and started taking it somewhere. It got loose and the chase started again.

This was weird because helicopters don't fly that high. Oh, a voice told him not to go down because there were enemy ships below. The next thing we were flying towards a corner like in a room, and this guy (a James Bond type character) asked us to let him off there. He asked me if he could stand on my knee to get a boost.

He said, \"How is it? Are you still doing the same old things?\" At which point I look at a stairway and the stairway is wooden and covered with cloth steps, these rug things they put over steps. I'm saying one shouldn't be deceived by these steps, that the important thing about them is not the rug on the top, but the grain of the wood underneath. Kytta says in response to this, \"The same old Jones,\" meaning I'm still more interested in interpreting things than in accepting them. Then we get ready to leave, and we're leaving this particular town, and I have to quickly make a choice, whether to invite Ed to come along with us or to leave him there, and I by impulse say, \"How about it, Ed, do you want to come along with us?\" He sort of heaves a big sigh and says something to the effect that if you'd only treated me that simply in the first place, I'd be a much better man today or something like that."

I was relaxing in their living room when another couple who lives behind this couple walked in. Of the second couple, the wife is very attractive and has a magnificent figure. I was thinking on this occasion as I have in real life, whether the husband was very adequate to the wife. The wife said she might like to go out and take a walk. It was raining slightly, so I said something to the effect that it was only drizzling very slightly and it might be nice to take a walk out there in the rain. So she walked out, started walking down the block, and then I came out to follow her. The neighborhood wasn't exactly like any neighborhood I've ever seen. It was somewhat similar to the terrain in San Francisco. The houses were up on sloping hills and she walked down to a house on the corner and sat on the grass on one of these slopes. I ran on the top of the slope and then ran down the slope and sat beside her. At this point when I reached her, she was no longer the wife of this guy. She was no longer the same girl, but she was Oriental. She had an Oriental face, which didn't surprise me somehow. She began talking in that inscrutable way of Orientals, with a little proverb, something about the fact that I would go very far in life, because I was good at business deals. For example, if I wanted to make a good deal on my brother's car (by the way, I have no brother and in the dream at the time I realized I didn't have a brother, yet it wasn't completely shocking to me). I sort of knew that this was an example, that she didn't really think I had a brother, but anyway if I sold my brother's car, I could sell half-interest in it for $200 plus ten dollars for title fee, and thus I would make an amazing profit. Somehow at the time I understood. That's the end of that dream."

The car was burning up because the radiator didn't have water in it, so I remember I -- as is the case in gas stations, you open the hood and you very carefully loosen the radiator cap and elt the steam begin to escape. While I was doing this, the boss, for example, came over. He was talking to the couple. He asked what kidn of car is the best, if they wanted to buy a new one. I remember the wife and husband were kind of, well, it was something to the effect that the wife wanted to get a new car so she was kind of hinting to my boss and said that the new cars were very good and so forth and that they should buy one. Anyway, I remember the boss said that he wasn't too sure about these new cars because with the new range of mechanics that were coming out, they could fix up a Ford very well. They could fix up any other kind of car very well. Then he wasn't too sure which was the best. As I said, while this was going on, I had finally gotten the radiator cap off and the car was steaming quite a bit. I kept putting water in the radiator. I told them to let the engine idle as you should. Then very naturally as you're supposed to do in this dream, I also brought the hose inside the car and was watering off the dashboard.

He was showing me a notebook. The notebook was filled with the names of certain male, only male relatives he pointed out of my girlfriend, cousins and uncles and so on. There were about 25 names in the book, and he pointed out to me that the ones that had x's over their names, that had made x marks after they had signed their names and addresses in the book, were the ones that didn't believe in God. Oh, and I think I remember that almost all of the names were Lesnik, that was their last name, different first names, but their last names were all or nearly all Lesnik. About 5 or 6 of the 25 didn't believe in God, and I remember being at the time very surprised that this didn't shock the father. He wasn't upset by it at all. So I remember thinking at the time that he didn't believe in God either. Then the only other part of the dream I remember was somehow I, though I hadn't been in the water, was wet and rather chilly. My girlfriend came over and brought me a towel. I recall the dream I think average or perhaps well and it's fairly vivid. The dream seemed at the time very plausible. It took place at some indefinite time, but obviously the present, that is to say the people and events were from the present time.

I don't remember a particular elevator or the building or what I was doing there. But we were going down in the elevator and all of a sudden it started falling. I remember I didn't panic, but very quickly went over to the control board. It was a self-service elevator, and there was one button for the light switched off, which I switched off, switched off the light, although afterwards I could still see in the elevator. But I remember switching off the light switch and hten I pressed the alarm button. There was no stop button, but there was an alarm button. I kept pressing it and I remember very clearly hearing it ring, not only in the elevator, but it sounded as though it would ring through the whole building, outside the elevator. Finally after some oscillations up and down, the elevator finally stopped and we were saved. Although this whole experience wasn't too emotional for me, I wasn't too afraid when the elevator was falling, nor was I too excited, exhilarated about being saved. I remember asking the foreman, the one who performed the saving operation, how he had done it, and he described it to me. I sort of pictured the whole thing and it was as though I was seeing how we were saved. That part is very hard to put into words, but I saw a line of about 6 elevators in the building. Ours was the last one over, and somehow the elevator shaft was pushed off, all the way to the end of a kind of line it was hanging on, as though there were six beads, say, on a string and the last bead were pushed to the end of the string. Then somehow it was flipped over. This whole thing is very hard to explain. It was a visual image and not at all rational in our sense, that is in my daily experience sense of the term, although in the dream it was very plausible, and he showed us how he pushed the elevator to the end of the line and kind of slipped it over the string it was hanging on and saved us all. The time of the dream was indefinite time. It was black and white. The setting wasn't familiar. This dream seemed to take 15 minutes perhaps."

I believe he even had one with him, that he was showing me. A human liver was like a scroll of paper which you could unroll and it would be a sheet and it would roll up into a cylinder. I asked him how he was doing on his finals and he said he was supposed to take four that morning, but that he had slept through them all. No particular emotions in that dream.

But I was rather confused and he was getting angry. He kept telling me something, but I couldn't hear him very clearly, how to close the door. So I was confused and finally it was as though the door was like a shower curtain on account of it came down, fell down. So I was rather perplexed at this. I knew he was extremely angry by now. He started coming in towards the house and I was thinking at the same time about if he wanted to start anything, any trouble, I wasn't afraid, not in the least, because he was a very small man, small, short, kind of not particularly masculine, no threat at all physically. I thought that perhaps I would just push him aside and ignore him. But as he was walking, I could see his face. He was really extremely angry. As he was walking towards me and getting very close, the face had such an expression of hate and anger that I was sure he was going to kill me or at least do me great physical harm. So I really began to get afraid because although he was very small, his face was so angry that I began to get almost a headache or ringing in my head. I was really afraid. It was obvious from his face that he was going to do something to me. The buzz of the headache increased so much that I woke up and it was morning."

I was on the extreme right, and there was a long, narrow carpet leading from the entrance of the room to a throne. On my immediate left was a man wearing a high silk hat, and he was the president of some country. He was also the holder of a Ph.D. and M.D. degree. On his immediate left was another president of a country who I believe was the holder of a Bachelor of Law degree. The three of us were in a very jovial mood. The purpose of our being there was to see the king. We were going to receive some kind of an award or very high sort of recognition of some sort from the king. We were striving jauntily towards the throne in very high spirits smiling and sort of the attitude of congratulations toward one another for the three of us being there on this, what seemed to be auspicious occasion. I would say there was even some levity in the situation, and as we got within a few steps of the throne, we stopped. The man to my immediate left in the high silk hat knew the king and he was going to introduce us to him. The king stood up and he said to the king, \"I would like to present to you ...\" and at this point a look of amused bewilderment came across his face, and he quickly broke out into a very large grin and started to chuckle and said that, \"I've forgotten how to pronounce your name,\" and this was addressed to the king. And at this comment, since the tension was very high, we all broke out in great guffaws of laughter, including the king. All 4 of us were laughing very long and very hard. Then the man in the high silk hat kind of got carried away and reached over and picked me up off the ground in sort of a bear hug. We all seemed to find this an extremely funny joke of some sort. That's all there was to the dream.This large room. The reception room in which this was all sort of taking place, the side walls were all windows, large portico type windows. The man to my left, the one who introduced us, was dressed in very unusual fashion, some sort of a sack-like coat. It almost looked like burlap. I don't know what my role was in this, but I felt a part of the trio. It was a very pleasant dream. There was no awareness of any time sequence. There may be some day residue associated with the concept of king in that there have been some comical statements made recently about Cassius Clay screaming that he was the king of the world and recently reading about the death of the King of Greece."

        "dream_content": "This dream took place in the Seaside Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where I was working as a waiter. There was also in the dream a playhouse attached to the hotel. For some reason they were having a play and one of the cast was not able to participate, and I somehow took his place. The play that was being presented was Hamlet, and I was to play Hamlet's brother. That night that the play took place, only the first act was presented and the next two acts were to be presented the next night. I didn't remember the actual play at all. I do remember immediately after the play. Two of the young owners of the hotel, Barbara and Bernie, came back stage and were congratulating everyone, and they especially looked to me and said something to the extent that, \"You did a great job. We're very proud of you,\" or something like that. At this the star of the play turned to me with a very jealous and enraged look on his face, but at this moment the curtain went up for another bow. The audience was cheering quite loudly, and myself and the star took our bows. Then we presumed that that was the last curtain call, and I started to look around for my jacket. It was a green jacket. I couldn't seem to find it. I also remember seeing the audience very clearly as a large group of people. I was looking for my jacket and finally I suppose it was about five minutes later and the theater had pretty much cleared out, and I opened the curtains thinking it might have been left in the orchestra pit or something, and there was a small row of boys left still cheering for some reason. Must have been about 12 of them all sitting very closely together, and there in the orchestra pit I did find my jacket lying on top of the piano. While I was taking one of my curtain calls, a woman in the audience spoke up and asked me if I was a graduate student or an actor, and I said I was only an actor as a hobby. I took this as a rather flattering question. In the beginning of this dream there was something else that preceded this, but in trying to remember the dream while I was still apparently in a sleep-like state, I was trying to recount the events of the dream and just before I started them, I dreamt that Dr. Hall came into my room and said something to the effect that, \"Roger, I hear you have a dream.\" I said, \"Yes, I'm trying to remember it now,\" or something like that, and he somewhat indicated to me that he knew some of the contents of the dream, that he had them typed out on a card, and this rather amazed me because at this point I felt if this was so, then he must have sent them to me by ESP. Having recovered from my amazement, I said, \"Well, I'm going to have to try to recall the dream now to get it nice and clear,\" and I went on to recall the dream, but 10 minutes later I woke up, fully awoke, so apparently this episode was either part of re-dreaming the dream a second time in an attempt to recall it or possibly it was just an additional part of the dream. It's very hard to say. Many of the events that I have described are real life settings such as my having been a waiter at the Seaside Hotel in Atlantic City. In fact, there was a playhouse, not attached to it, but right next to it. It belonged to another hotel and a friend of mine was in a play there, but none of this is really day residue although it all comes from memories of the past."

It takes place in a drug store, and as I walk into the drug store I recognize a girl at the counter who I went to high school with. Next to her in a small cradle of some sort is a child, very young child. I went over to her and asked her, \"How are you getting along, and to whom are you married? Who is your husband?\" She said something to the extent that, \"Well, I can't have one.\" She couldn't have a husband. I then got the impression of two guys who I knew that had been dating her. Someone at this point carried a large rack of cakes past us. They were all rolls, like jelly rolls, but they were slightly bigger. She continued our conversation and said she had remained alright in spite of the situation. I looked at the baby. It was about 1 year old. This situation, meaning that I felt certain that this was an illegitimate child. Thoughts then of making a play for this girl pass through my mind. She looked into my eyes and asked, \"How come you look that way?\" I knew she was referring to the dark rings around my eyes. I said, \"That's because I've just finished studying for a big exam, and I haven't been getting much sleep for about nine days.\" Her comment was, \"Well!\" Then I said, \"You should have stayed in school like me and avoided getting involved with anything.\" She said, \"Well, we didn't let them get to either one of us anyway.\" By this she meant that we really didn't let people get to us anyway and hurt us. The faint impression that she was wrong about herself passed through my mind. For some reason I had to leave and we parted very friendly. I then thought, \"I can really make this girl. Then so could anybody else who wants to. So what's the big deal? She's not that hard to make, and why don't you pick someone who's not so easy to make?\" While in the drug store I had seen several people there - the waitress who was dressed in a white uniform and the policeman who was dressed in a blue uniform and several customers sitting at the counter. As I left the drug store, the setting was identical to a corner drug store in Audubon, N.J. where I lived for many years.Day residue: Next to a drug store yesterday. I went to a drug store yesterday. I also got a letter from my brother who's wife is ready to have a baby any day now, and she's having trouble carrying the child. One of the girl's teeth in the dream seemed bad. It seemed sort of decayed and this might derive from the telling and retelling yesterday of what struck me as a hilarious Yiddish epithet, translated it is, \"All your teeth should fall out but one, and in that one you should have a toothache.\""

I looked around and Phyllis was the only one left and the one I least desired to sleep with. She was lying down on a bed with her arms outstretched to me. I took off my clothes and with a mental shrug of indifference lay down beside her. She embraced me and her body was warm and soft -- more pleasing than I had anticipated. Then I woke up."

A teacher (professor) gave lectures to his class. He (the teacher) could see into our bedroom and it appeared that he spent more time looking into our bedroom than at his class. My wife complained about this. We were both in the same bed, and I looked up and he was watching us. So I went out into the courtyard and told him to mind his own business (words were exchanged and I got the best of him verbally, although I can't remember the exact argument). Later a girl in a yellow dress told me that this same professor said I was sleeping with a woman other than my wife. He said that is what he saw. I went out in the courtyard again, but the class he was teaching went into an uproar and laughed at me. I went back into the house and into my desk and got my .22 automatic and walked out with it under my shirt. The students gathered around when they saw I had a gun under my shirt. So I took the gun out and held it in the open. I was walking down a cobblestone street looking for the professor. The students (boys and girls my age dressed in many colors) tried to dissuade me. They got close and I fired a shot at their feet. The shot was weak, more like a b-b gun than a .22. someone mentioned this fact in the crowd, so I fired a few more times and the .22 acted more like a .22 than a b-b gun. I found the teacher walking down the street with two of his friends (both rude, all of them older than myself). I fired a shot in front of him and was going to fire another shot, but I realized I was out of ammunition. (The gun clicked empty.) So I tried a bluff. I went over to him and told him to take back the lie about my sleeping with someone other than my wife. He refused. I gave him the count of ten to change his mind. He refused and closed his eyes. I counted down from 10-9-8-7-6-5. At the count of ______ or between 3 and 4, I placed the barrel of the gun against his forehead. He was visibly shaken. At the count of 2, he said he would change his story and then said he couldn't really tell who was sleeping with me. With a little further argument, he said it must have been my wife.

There is snow and snow banks on the ground. Wally starts turning the car around in weird directions. I ask him what he's doing, but then he pulls into the driveway perfectly. We get out of the car. It's daytime and there is no snow on the ground: it's summer. I walk from the driveway onto the grass. Wally warns me to not walk there, but I do anyway. I fall through the grass, which is actually a thin covering for my dad and Lisa's underground greenhouse-type area. My dad and Wally also fall through. They yell and scream at me in their characteristic ways, saying they warned me and that it's my fault. This is true: I didn't heed the warning. The greenhouse is about four feet deep, and there are wooden 2x4's supporting the grass above in various places. The spot that we fell through is a portion of this area. There is an old dirty window with a lot of yellow jacket bees swarming and crawling on it. There are some broken boards from where we fell, and I try to fix them. We can't really stand up because we'd break the grass \"roof\" again. Lisa comes out of the house. I think she is mixing cookie dough. She is mad, but of course, doesn't really show her anger."

I shake Nelson and Simon's hand, asking how its' going. Then I slide into the booth, which is a semicircle, and sit next to Annie. I kiss her and she kisses me. I feel awkward kissing her in front of everyone. She starts kissing and licking on my left ear. It feels good. I kiss her neck and mouth. We pause; I think I should order food. The waitress hands us menus. Everyone orders, I am last. I can't decide what to get, and then think that I want the Blockbuster. I turn to the menu page on the menu where it is, but see that when you order it you get a hamburger, not pancakes, eggs, and hash browns. I see that and don't want it.

A big bass jumps ahead of me and to the right. I see it. It was floating near the surface of the water, looking almost dead. Its head was near the surface and its tail submerged. I trolled over it. It was a monster largemouth bass, at least 10 pounds, absolutely huge! I was going to reach in and grab it by the mouth, but I didn't and it swam away. I am then in a stream with clear shallow water, and it is daytime. I'm trying to hit the fish with an oar to kill it, but it quickly swims away."

There are four ice-fishing holes in the house, whereas normally there are two. Stephen's rod is a normal size fishing rod, and is sitting outside the house, propped up, like in carp fishing. He gets a bite. His rod tip bends as the slack line peels out. I quickly grab his rod and yell to Stephen that I think there is a big carp on his line. The ice is then gone, and we are in a swampy, marshy area with a little bit of open water. The carp makes a strong run, and I run after it, while letting line out so it doesn't snap, as well as taking line in to keep the line tight. I walk down by the viaduct. Stephen yells that there is a big dog on the end of the line! It is a German Shepard, and it's mad! I slip and fall into the swamp up to my waist. The dog makes a run directly at me.

I don't have any money to pay, so I go home and get some, riding my old red Huffy bike back to the gas station. I pay for the gas and get a scratch lottery ticket with the extra dollar. It doesn't win. I get five more. None are winners. I get another, and it's a Q-Bert scratch ticket. I get five white Q-Berts with black glasses on and win $10,000. I wonder if that is my big winning. I think not, I am going to win more sometime. When I get out of the gas station, my truck is gone. The trailer part of the truck is by Curtis' house in Oak Valley.

There are some guys there from high school, including Simon Naver. We talk about college. I am making my way out of the gymnasium. Melanie McDyss, a friend from college, comes up and kisses me! I say, \"Melanie, what are you doing?!\" Then I realize that she's been drinking. She giggles and wanders off with a friend.I am being dragged, and am also dragging a person, towards the exit. I see my mom. I'm embarrassed to be seen playing with two girls, but I go up to her and tell her that I'm leaving. It is icy outside. My sister Ramona just got her drivers permit, and I might let her drive, but there is something wrong with the car: it's locked. I unlock it. It's running. We need to back it out but it is too icy, so I have one of Ramona's friends push. Her friend is then in the driver's seat pushing back on the seat. I am in the back seat at the steering wheel. We start backing out. I yell at her to stop pushing. She doesn't, and I yell again. We are going to hit a car. I yell and finally she hears me. The car slides sideway and bumps a little red car, leaving a dent. There is a new blue truck there too, and I probably dented it, but I'm not taking responsibility for that; just for the red car. I find a police officer and tell him that I hit a car. He asks me if I admit it was my fault. I say yes. He tells me my insurance or I have to pay full damages. We are parked in a parking ramp, and I send someone to up to get my mom. People are eating this horrible-looking green pizza form Pizza Hut. There is a girl there that looks a lot like Nellie Hammer, and woman that sat in front of me in a geography class at Brimson. She is drunk and she hits on me. I get away from her: she is ugly. I am really mad about this whole situation. I'm walking up stairs to the gym to get my mom, and I wonder: Is this real? Am I really here? Is this happening? I awaken."

I'm about to shove it down my pants, when a girl looks up the stairs and sees me. I toss it aside, saying that I'm just joking. I go down another flight of stairs. Again there is a Penthouse. I want to take it, but there are people around. I go down a third flight, and find a third Penthouse. I don't get to take the Magazine. Brownie Bruny, a person I know from grade school that was a year older than I, is there at the bottom of the stairs. I have never liked her. There is a room there with a party atmosphere. People are dressed up. Brownie is wearing a wig and is as snobby as ever. My friend Simon Naver is lying on the floor. I can tell it's him by his pants. They are all leather and look like the leather jacket he has. I go over to him, he gets up, and we shake hands. We're happy to see each other. We shake hands again. I almost hug him but feel that would be inappropriate."

The wife comes and throws a fit of anger, screaming and jumping up and down. I think she is going to kick me. I could beat her and run, but I stay. I yell at her, asking how much she wants me to pay for the windows. I think I have enough. I ask her, \"How many Yen?\" She doesn't answer. Her husband comes. I try to get out of trouble by paying them for the damage. I don't think it works."

The ejected blasts come closer and overtake the earth, engulfing it. I see fire and debris rushing and crashing over the horizon. I tell my sisters to hide under the back of the station wagon, which is down. I see fire shoot over our heads. It is certain doom. I wonder if people near water will live.

People are grabbing me and pushing me, trying to stop me from scoring. The goal is different now: it is an indentation in the side of the pool. One of the discs has to be put in it to score. I punch or thrust my arm and head into the opening with a maximum effort. People are on me. I think I score.Then we are down by the other team's goal. One of the yellow discs has burst, and en eye came out of it. I give the disc and eye to Thad. I yell for Annette. I large woman and her clan of kids comes over. Her name is Annette too. I tell her no, that I meant Annette Gollum. A security guard then walks around the edge of the pool. He jumps in feet first, in full uniform. He surfaces a little later with a glass jar of pink grapefruit juice and something else. The lady Annette and the guard tell us of something that is in the pool, that has been lurking around. A person names Winston is in the pool, underwater. He is clothed, and upside down. He has blown out all his air. Kyle Rappaport is on the bottom of the pool, in the fetal position. Someone says something about this creature that is in the pool. I look down at Winston and Kyle and see that they are being held down by a black tentacle-like ribbon of flesh. The tentacles are coming out of a grate on the bottom of the pool. I realize Winston has been there for an hour and is dead, and that Kyle has been there 10 or 15 minutes and is probably dead too. Then the tentacles loosen. Their bodies begin to float up. I yell and run away. I know these people are dead. I stop and get some change from the bunk bed before I leave the area."

One of the men who dies is wheeling his wheelchair across train tracks going over a river. A train comes while the man is on the tracks above the river. Before he can get off the tracks he is hit by the train and dies.This is what I see on television. My three siblings and I watch this on television. My sister Heather is flirting with me. I don't say anything and don't flirt back. I know what she doesn't know. She doesn't know I am her brother, until some family friends, the Kissengers, walk by and say, \"Hi Hanson kids!\" Then she realizes who I am."

I'm in a group of people. I see a meteor. Another person points it out too. It goes across the sky, which is a mixture of green and black. The sky becomes mostly green with a black shadow-like image of dangling spider-like legs. The black streaks contract. As they do the surface of the ocean breaks. I don't want to fall in. Other people do want to fall in. People want to go to Candyland, as it seems, which is a fun place, or so I hear. I don't want to go because I'll have to swim back. I fall into the water, which is very warm. It is sweet and thick, like chocolate. In this place everyone is playing a game. The goal of the game is to accumulate something, or some things, in a certain proportion. To begin, I run and climb up a series of air-filled plastic tube mountains. The area is wet, like a water park. I think I will do well. I beat the crowd up the structure and grab money and other items, including a checkbook and passport. The things I accumulate are money, power, and wealth. These clues are later no good. I clutch my hand full of paper bills and other wealth. My friend Bubba Hacker is chasing me. I run and jump off a tube structure, diving into the pool of water below. I over rotate in the dive and land on my back. Bubba follows me.There are other ways to play the game; other things to do. I have a small plastic object that looks like a clear remote control. I'm trying to accumulate red or light purple dots on it. I do this by coming into contact with people who have red or light purple dots in their possession, since more than one person can share some clues. I succeed in getting some red dots. I get \"ambushed\" by people, including my brother Wally. We wrestle in the water for what I have in my hand. I think it is my checkbook. Normally in water, I am afraid of being pushed under. I really want the checkbook though, and go under the water and grab onto it with both hands. A man reads off the scores of the game for the first round. I didn't do well. My high school classmate George German did well. My family's friend Erika Hedgcock did well too.As the man reads, I see Annie. We are walking by each other. I put my arm around her as we walk. She puts her arm around me. We walk up stairs, and she jokingly says to me that I better not flirt with the lady that is walking in front of us. I say yeah.The second round starts. Immediately I pick up a bunch of different clues, including dice, figurines, a match stick-like structure, and small plastic animals that are size of a quarter. They act like keys, I think, and enable one to go further into a particular area. I think maybe I should have just gotten one or two clues in some area. I go into a place of lodging. It is fake; made up for the game. It's a sort of primitive house. I am going to make porridge. I'm alone, and don't really know what to do. My high school classmate Nathan Plumber and my junior high social studies teacher Gary Lashing are there. Another kid starts to make a fire. He needs a clue. I have it; it is the matchstick. It is cracked, but I try it anyway. I light the match and try to light a bigger object using it."

She is supposed to kiss me as part of the game, but she is embarrassed to. I kiss her on the cheek in a friendly manner. Two 2's are rolled on the dice. People have to connect the dots on the blackboard and find the perimeter of the parallelogram it makes. The sides are 20 and 36 units long. I think the perimeter is 56. I'm wrong. Its' 2.1, or about 1%. I am in a geography class. My geography professor at Brimson, Meg Shine, is the teacher. I get a paper back, on which I did really well. I forgot about the \"intermittent zones\" in the paper. I have only one pen in my desk. I leave school. I say goodbye to Meg. I am wearing my old black and pink winter jacket. I walk down the hall with my friend Tiny Combs. The school secretary's daughter and two other people look at us as we leave. The steps are wet because they've just been mopped. Tiny and I think a man we lifted weights with, Troy Swanson, might be teaching first grade, but he is not. Some karate guy is teaching first grade, and is playing Mettalica. I go back to my truck in the parking lot. A classmate named Cory Pineman looks like he wants a ride. My friend Brian Candle walks by. We chat. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, and Hilary Nano show up. I greet them. Nat looks like he is mentally retarded. He is really tired from the plane ride. We go to my house."

While I am waiting, my sister Heather and two young black men come and harass me. They knock and pound on the windows of my mom's station wagon, which I am driving. I am then in the back seat, behind the driver's seat. One of the men is in the car sitting next to me. He jokes and teases me saying he is going to vomit in my car. I say, \"No, please, don't vomit.\" We're about 15 feet from the drive up window. I say the lady won't let me get my money unless I pull up to the window. I pull the car up to the teller, but the tube with the money and transaction statement in it is covered with mail. The two guys push my car backwards. I run and stop it, stepping on the brake. I don't sit down in the car because the man vomited on the driver's seat. The vomit looks like the donut sprinkles. I swear! Heather drives away in a gray car. I pick up and stack big bags of potatoes and something else. I think that it's tough to love Heather when she does stuff like this. I curse her name. I think of the Butter-Cream movie in which the philosophy is always to be kind and respect others no matter how they treat you."

On the other hand, if I ejaculate quickly upon receiving fellatio, she knows I was aroused previously, but did not ejaculate."

We drive to the concert in a big, fancy red car, which is kind of like a Cadillac, but isn't. We leave it parked where people give their cars to valets, but we don't give the valet the keys. I go back later, when there are two valet employees, and give one of them the keys, which are on my Brimson key chain. The car is to be parked in a subway garage. I have a new suit for the occasion. I wear a t-shirt under it: no shirt or tie. I have nice new black shoes too. I don't wear a shirt, only the pants and shoes. My roommate's girlfriend Natasha talks to me as we watch part of the show. The Three Tenors are women with violins. The concert turns into a lecture, and one woman puts up an overhead projection and draws complex note patterns on it. All the people leave because it is boring. The Bough parents are the last two people there. My classmates Sonya Nittles and Fariba Touse are there and talk to me. As I leave, I wave at Sonya, who went out before me. We are going back to the car. There is a Santa Claus cake with hard frosting on it. We smash the cake on the sidewalk."

I am with my friend Elise Rooks. We are sitting on the ground on the east side of Wilmerton. We flirt. I really want to make out with her. I act silly, like I am a little drunk, in hopes that her flirtatiousness will get carried away. We are then at Elise's house. There is a phone call for me.

My friend Kevin Simpson and I are there already. The ending point of the funeral is a parking lot in which there are many poles sticking up to mark off the lanes for traffic. We see a monster truck with huge tires. The tires have weird tread, like a saw blade. Then we see the hearse pull into the lot. It is like a battering ram, tough and square looking.

Mark talks about cutting the veins on the inside of his leg near his groin. They are back from the dead for one year, but only if their spouse had approved. Mark talks more about cutting himself: how and where. The neighbor woman is topless. She has a scar from shoulder to shoulder across her chest, and two scars down each upper pectoral muscle. I don't want to look at the scars. Kevin and Mark and I are in the corner of the room. There are blinds near us, almost wrapping around us. I reach my arms around both of them at the same time and grab the blinds. I hold them very tightly, and tell them what I think of suicide. I tell them that I think it's a cop out. That it is the easy way out and it is inconsiderate: the people that love you will really be hurt. Then I walk away. I talk to my dad. Looking over in the corner, I see that there are two straight bodies laying separately on the cement floor. I go to say goodbye to Mark. The two are standing. I don't' know what to say to Mark. We hug and cry. It's hard to keep my balance. We hug for a long time. There is violin music playing in the background. The hug is very therapeutic. It was a release, a letting go after a long time, which was overdue."

I do into the bathroom to masturbate, but it is not a private bathroom. There is a hallway going into the bathroom. I walk out. Bill from Bill's Country Farm Stand is there. Our van comes to pick us up. It is a van for the chicken catchers. We are all going to a recreational spot: a lake cabin or something. We get there. The place has two floors. On the bottom floor there are some attractive young women at a desk, like at the Middle Mall Fitness Center which I go by often. I am naked. I have my green towel to cover me. I have underwear and shorts in my hand but no place to change into them. My high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker is there. He is growing a good beard. My friend Mya Rousing is there.

A woman is trapped in a place with three men. They are going to rape her. The woman is on the phone with someone to help her. Somehow she gets cunnilingus given to her. It is as if her body is in a different place, or in two places at once. I see her. She is sexually aroused while on the phone. The goal of the people talking to her is to make her give them the address of where she is so they can come and get her. They are going to give her cunnilingus until she tells them. Eventually it is going to get painful, and that will make her tell them. (This is a confusing dream.)"

A different, more powerful manager, gives me a bag to get more apricots. I walk through people's yards, and get the apricots. There are three men beating each other, fighting. They seem crazy. One of them yells at me to come over and fight with them. I am scared. I walk away slowly so as not to agitate them, then I run. I pick up beer cans and put them on top of the apricots.

My mom is yelling instructions or reminders to me as I go. I don't want to leave outright, but I ride slow and listen to her. I think she goes to the corner of 2nd and Home Avenue to call out final instructions. I want to raise the seat of the bike up so I can fully extend my legs when I pedal. I have to stop and adjust the seat several times. I ride into the Partridge's yard on the corner of 2nd and Old Avenue. I ride around the outside of their house, and am going to ride down the hill in front of their house and onto the street. I go past a window. The Partridge family sees me. I think they might throw something out the window at me. When I get to the front of the house I dodge the shrubs. There is a wire fence, and I stop. There are random pieces of wood that the kids have used to play. I pick up the bike and walk over the wood and step over the fence to get out of the yard."

The road is not in good repair: it is cracked and torn up. I ride near Dan Hellman's house and cross over the railroad tracks there. I may walk across the path, because it is not paved. I am riding up the road towards Bill's Barber Shop. I shift into an easier gear. I am at a house where construction is occurring. I have a front-end-loader on my arms. There is a pile of sand there. A man says they are done with work for today, and to leave the front-end-loader; we'll do more tomorrow. There is a screened in area with a chimpanzee in it. It wants to smoke a cigarette. I light it, but it burns too short. The chimpanzee is going to burn itself, so I slap the cigarette out of its hand and stomp on it. The chimpanzee needs to be locked up. I close the two doors on the porch, and lock the outside door. The inside door needs to be locked too. There is a hole and a latch for the inside door. I encourage the chimpanzee as it tries to lock the door. Then there are two loops that a latch must be inserted through horizontally. Then the two loops are two much larger circles, and the latch is a key, which the chimpanzee puts through the circles. When it tries to latch the smaller loops, the chimpanzee is a Chinese girl. There is a pumpkin nearby.I'm at home. The boat is in the back yard covered with a tarp. My sister Heather and her friend Joanne have dumped out some of my beer by the boat. I think it was Miller Genuine Draft. My cousins Melvin and Rich Redding are there. We tip the boat up and Rich takes the trolling motor off the boat. I hold the boat, and tell him to be careful. The trolling motor has no steering head. I ask Melvin and Rich if I have used the boat since it has been wrapped up for the winter. I can't remember if I have. There is a canoe in our yard. It separates into two layers. I carry one layer towards the garage. Melvin carries the other."

His penis is more than a foot long, and it is limp. Madonna talks about Dennis Rodman's penis. Niles leaves. Madonna and I start to get it on. She is masturbating. I give her cunnilingus, and rub her clitoris with my finger. We kiss. We are clothed, and then are naked. She is going to perform fellatio on me, but I give her cunnilingus again instead. My sister Ramona, who was gone with my mom, comes into the room. She has a sheet of paper with a lot of caricatures on it. There are some sketches of her and of I. Madonna and I leave to get privacy. I say to Madonna that we can go to my room, and that she can stay the night. We are on the stairway. She says we can go to her house, which is 30 minutes away. We decide to go. I grab my jacket and my dream journal. My family knows I am going to Madonna's house for the night. It's winter outside. I go out the door. There is a limousine. I am headed for the back seat, when the driver gets out and tells me to drive. I say okay, and get in. I am sitting on a seat, and there is a bucket seat between the steering wheel and I. The limo driver gives me directions. I turn around near the Roman's house on Home Avenue, and go north on Home Avenue, past my house. My mom is on the side of the road. I slow down, but when I hear her saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea that I go, I speed away. My sister Ramona is venturing out in the street in front of me waving her arms. She doesn't think it's a good idea for me to go, either. I speed up and she has to dodge the limousine to avoid being hit.At Madonna's house, I am playing a large game of golf and some other mystery game. There are two other guys with me. I go to hole number two. I have to climb down a rocky cliff-like formation. The hole is 581 yards long. There is an island where one has to chip the ball up onto a ridge. There is a huge fossil of a fish, about 20 or 30 feet long, at the beginning of this hole in the rock formation. I am looking at another area: how to play that hole. It is rock, but then it turns into a building. I realize that Madonna isn't real: she is fake. It was all a set up to lure people somewhere (here?). There are strong machine-like men there. They have some power. I try to hurt them, but I can't. They hurt me. There is a group of people there, including my friend Beth Mock. We keep the men from coming in through the doorways. There is a cage-like structure with electric chairs in it. A lady tells a story. The people in the cage are set free. I go in. There is an attractive woman in the cage. We introduce ourselves. Her name is Steph. She gets nervous and wants to get out of the cage. We discover there is a fake serum. The serum allows us to beat the men. A kid fakes craziness, and is able to kill one of the men by stabbing him in the throat. I get into the room where they make the serum, though I don't find any of it."

There is a place on the screen that says, \"touch screen here\", surrounded by colorful spirals. I touch the screen on that spot. The screen becomes full of action.

She is rubbing her body up against mine. She goes down to give me fellatio. I pull off her pants and roll over. We are in position \"69\", where I am on top of her with my head between her legs. She says something about who will orgasm first, and also says something about me squishing her kidneys. I am then giving her cunnilingus. Below her pubic hair her vagina is very smooth.

The printing on the map is light red, and isn't very clear.I am then with a larger group of people. My dad is there teaching younger kids how to fish. He is doing his crazy casting with a bobber. The water is really deep. I want to jump in, but I don't want to be wet later. My friend's father, Dilbert Simpson, is there. My dad hooks a fish. He has super strong line on his reel, and the line will not break. It is a northern pike. At first I think it is a Walleye. I net the fish right before it spits out the lure, which is a Red Eye Wiggler. My dad wants to keep the fish to eat for dinner. The fish are all over in the water; pike are everywhere. We can see them in the water. I really want to fish! My high school friend Daryl Yeller and his brother go by, like they are on a river. I say hi."

I lay the motorcycle down and walk towards Super America. I realize I don't have my wallet, so I can't redeem my lottery ticket. I walk back. There are two men shaving their hair off with big knives. My motorcycle is then the orange lawn chair that my mom has. I want to leave. The two men are hostile. They talk about someone from Hillston, or the area around Hillston. They don't like the person they are talking about. I sit down in the orange lawn chair. It is breaking. I want to leave. The men may think or act like I am the person they don't like. Either they or I say or sing a song with the words to a song, \"Ba Ba Billy, we look to you for guidance.\" I remember the melody to the song after awakening."

I am driving a really nice truck, towing my boat behind it. It is early in the morning. I go around back of the shack and climb up on the roof. My dad goes by on the road between the hill and the old Simon's Grocery Store. He is driving his red Ford LTD Crown Victoria, and pulling a boat. I see him. He doesn't see me. He knew I was going fishing, but I didn't know he was. He sees my boat and the truck. He thinks this is odd because I usually leave the trailer at home. I go back to the truck and check the electrical connection between the truck and trailer. The connection is as big as a fist. The boat lights don't work. I drive down the hill, though I have no brake lights. I go into Simon's Grocery Store parking lot. I drive between two cement pillars in the parking lot. It seems like I am not in a truck, but on a bicycle. There is a lady in the parking lot taking down cornstalks from the previous day's festivities. The lady says I'll be insured, I just have to tell the insurance company. I drive away. I see a car driving down a road. The hood of the car is open a few inches. Black smoke and flames are pouring out from the windows and under the hood. There are two people in the car. I think the car is going to crash into two cars that are stopped at a red light. I think that seeing this is the kind of crazy, funny story to tell my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson. The car stops, and a man gets out. He is on fire! He is calm. I see nothing that indicates that the flames affect him. The man is wearing sunglasses, and kind of old and dirty denim clothes. He has short curly brown hair. I stop and get off the bicycle that I am then on. He crosses the road and comes up to my home in Oak Valley, slowly and calmly, while on fire. He goes to the front door and enters without knocking. I realize what he is going to do: he is going to hurt my mom or my sister Ramona. I race across the road from the parking lot to the house. I go in the garage, where the big old garage door was. There are a bunch of knives near the door; they are like the kitchen knives we have at home, but are two or three feet long. I grab a knife. I rush into the dining room.

I see my friend Stephen Ramos at a table that seems pretty full. As I enter the place, my high school basketball teammate John Kulik walks out. I say hi. There is a lot of food on the tables: salads and other dishes. I sit with some men who are unfamiliar to me. They are in their early 30's, and seem like dorks. One of them is like Tom Ziegler, but rounder. One of them says he put an Ice House beer in the punch bowl to get the punch cold. I see the beer. I think my friend Nate Nelling may be there. I eat quickly, and drink lemonade. I say that I'm very hungry, but then I stop eating. I see two guys who I think are my cousins, Henry and Avery King. Then I realize that these are my friends Niles and Tim Zelling. There are some young women there who are part of the Jewish community. They dance down the long rows of tables. Everyone claps as the girls pass. Some people give a standing ovation. People sit on the floor behind their chairs as the girls dance. The girls dance between the person and the chair. They do this to me, and I move out into the aisle a little bit. I'm one of the only people sitting on my side of the table. There is a very long row of tables. One side of the tables is filled with people, and one side is sparsely populated. My friend Yvette Ullman is one of the dancers in the next aisle. I stare at her to make eye contact. She looks and sees me while she is dancing, but doesn't give me her characteristic smile. My dad is there, and he is now leaving. I walk with him to the back of the building, which is now a church. We talk about when we'll see each other next. He is coming through town next weekend. I tell him I have a lot of work to do, so Friday between noon and 2 p.m. would be good. Otherwise, we'll have to just get together really quick, because I need the other time to work. As my dad exits the church, my classmate Robyn Masters enters, and I hold the door for her. I feel dumb saying to my dad that I don't have a lot of time to visit, while Robyn is there.I go back inside the church. I start to walk up to the front of the church and I hear a voice that says, \"Kenneth, there's a service going on here!\" I quickly turn around and walk out, apologizing. The woman who spoke is sitting on the end of a pew, dressed in blue with brown hair. She kind of reminds me of my ex-girlfriend's mother, Tamara Thomas, but also of all the other \"respectable\" women that haven't liked me and have reprimanded and embarrassed me. I walk out of the building with a classmate named Keith and another guy. We go to Keith's car. On the way to the car, we climb up a very steep bank covered in thick grass, to get to the parking lot. I am then crawling on the hood of the car, gripping where the hood meets the windshield. Keith is in the back seat, and then he opens the driver's door. I say that I'll drive, but as Keith gets into the driver's seat, I say that I'd better not drive, because I might crash his father's nice car. There is a box of Marlboro cigarettes under the radio. We start to drive. I'm in the front seat. Keith takes out a package of vitamin C drops and opens it. They are yellow and orange, and are the consistency of Pepto Bismol. The two guys I am with say these drops put them to sleep after a big meal. The Shabbat was in the church basement. It is dark and snow is on the ground. A man on a bike with two small children on the bike is riding towards us. Keith isn't looking. I yell at him to swerve. The man swerves to his left, while we swerve to our right. We are pulling a boat or a trailer. I don't think we hit the man, but the car behind us did. The man and the kids fly ahead of us. We stop. I run out ahead of the others. I go to the man. He is a person I know from Brimson names James Vegas. He says, \"Just give me the bill now!\" He is hurt and angry. I tell him not to move. \"The more you move now, the more pain you will be in later\", I tell him. I yell to a lady at a nearby house to dial 911. I take off my jacket and put it on James. I tell the others to do the same. They do. We put their jackets on the children, who are babies. One is an infant with a cone-shaped top of its head. The infant has some red scrapes on its head."

There are a few parts of the bridge in various stages of construction. I lay some cement blocks. I have some pixie sticks and a small magazine, which may have pornography in it. A man comes and explains the structure of the bridge to me. There is an outside path: a strolling lane. It's a love strolling lane. The man describes the plans for this. A class is going on a trip to the love lane. It is a rambunctious class. Mother Theresa and a man are there. We're all by the White House. The President may be there. The class and I are taking photographs of Mother Theresa and the man. No one goes up to her. I move closer to her, and then go up to her. She asks me where I see God. I tell her I see it in the sun, warm and loving. Then the whole class comes over and sits with us.There are some women fast-pitch softball players batting. They are batting from the area where the short stop fields. One girl hits the ball to the outfield fence on one hop. I say that would have been a home run. My friend Nat Miller and I watch. Our classmate Pauline Davies may be playing."

He runs and jumps up on a couch, putting his feet up on the back of the couch where one would lean back. He leaves footprints of splattered paint on the couch. Another person splatters paint footprints on the couch. A person I know from Brimson, Alec Johnson, is there. He and I cover a couch up with a blanket.

I'm in a small round two-person dome tent. I do something with the sides and door flaps in an attempt to make the tent roomier. I set up things in the tent for Ivory and I. I have tissues and other items because I think we are going to, and want to, have sex. The tent is crowded. There is a rain fly on the tent. Two sleeping bags are on the floor. Ivory doesn't sleep there. She sleeps in my mom's bedroom.We are on an island/mountain area. I go and explore. I find a crack in the side of a rock that leads to a cave. There is a lake or river right near the cave. The cave is on the edge of an island, like on Jap Lake. There is a white dock and a white airplane across from the island on the shore. The plane might be taking off. The dock seems to break in half, and form a \"v\". There are coins in and around the crack and cave. There are a lot of old pennies from the 1900's. I find a 1920D penny. There are others that are very old, and that I think are valuable.I go back to the others. Ivory is wearing a black bra and underwear in my mom's room. I jokingly say to her that I \"wanted to rape you\", but you weren't sleeping in the tent. There is a set of keys that are Ivory's. I put them on my key chain lock so we don't lose them. I go back to the cave with Hank, Fran, Anita, and Ivory. Our group has two flashlights. It is dark. We go through my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard. The cave is near the bushes in the front of his yard, next to the gray house that is just to the west of his yard. Alvin is in the basement doing laundry. There may be another man there. I have trouble finding the site at first, because I look too far west of where it actually is. I move along the rocky cliff and find the crack and the cave. Everyone is excited. Next to the cave is a man-made hollow cavern with wooden walls. It is a shop, a cover-up for something. Something is going on in this location. A bridge is needed to access that place. There are bad guys coming with a bridge. I start walking towards Main Street on Hill Avenue. I whisper for my friend Jill Banks to come to, and she does. We evade the bad guys. We walk on the sidewalk up to my neighbor Greg Olson's steps. We then go up his steps and sidewalk to his front door, and then jump off the steps at his door to the right and run around the house. We run in back of the house and go back towards Alvin Broud's house.There are four men on Hill Avenue smashing a car. They seem to be yuppies. We are then back at Alvin's yard with the others. As we try to enter a house or cavern, an alarm is tripped and sounds. The four men run over to us. We try to run, but the men are among us. We fight them. We have wrenches as weapons. A person I have met before, David Brice, is among the bad men. I hit him in the face with a wrench. There is an older man there, who is about 40 years old. I have the yellow plastic bat that my roommate Stephen Ramos keeps under his bed. There is another man there who has a bat. We beat the older man. I hit the man twice in the face, back, and groin.

One of the men is tall and fat. The other man is smaller. The larger man is stabbed with a pen in the jaw or neck, stabbed with a knife, and cut with a razor blade. The man is unaffected. A vacuum sucks out a lot of the larger man's blood. He is unaffected. The smaller man is scared and runs. The area in which they fight is a v-shaped channel with water in the middle and metal on the sides. The large man writes two columns of lines.

We are down by his brother Jose's deer stand. We see a huge black bear. We slowly walk backwards. The huge bear wanders away. I see two more black bears. They are smaller than the first, but still big. Then there are many bears all over the place. Stephen and I each have a shotgun with slugs. Stephen puts on a bear mask. It looks like the real head of a bear. The bears come near to me. I shoot three of the bears in the head: Jake and two other bears. Another bear, which is my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, is upon me, and I am out of slugs. I awake from this dream, and don't have my dream journal. Stephen tells me I should have defecated before I went to bed because I was farting in my sleep. I know this isn't possible, but don't say anything to him. We are at our deer-hunting campsite. Jose and Franco Ramos are there too. I look out the door of our tent and see two hunters walking down the path along the fence towards Jose's deer stand. It is getting light outside. I realize we have overslept and are losing valuable hunting time. I get up. I have my Washington University pajama pants on. I go out of the tent. There are two men on the edge of our camp. They are on the edge of the woods. Our camp seems to be between the house and the woods, just south of the house. The men see a buck, and we see it too. It is close to camp, and we are in the line of fire for these men, so we move. The men scare the buck by throwing a flaming piece of two by four wood at it and firing a shot in front of it. The deer runs. Everyone fires at the deer, including Jose. At first, it looks like Jose is using a handgun. The deer escapes unscathed. It runs into the field. People fired shots to make it run in a certain direction, so they could shoot it. I am looking for my bag of clothes. I can't find it."

I think of shooting to make the deer run directly towards me, but I don't. I do fire, and I hit the deer. It is a big deer: it looks like a horse! It has six or eight antler tines. It runs into a nearby wooded and field area and falls down. I'm with my hunting party looking for the deer. We're in a house. It is pouring rain outside, really hard. Out in the field I see a lightning rod that is being continuously struck with lighting. People had just put the rod up early in the day. People also put blaze orange panels on the roof of a house, like insulation. I go into a small room, which is empty, dirty, wet, and tan in color. My party and I walk through a hunting camp while looking for our deer. There are two guys hunting, but not for deer. They point us to our deer, which is about 100 feet in a different direction. We see it, and go get it. Most of the deer's antlers have fallen off. It has only two big tines remaining, like an antelope. I think it must not be the one that I shot because that deer had a big six or eight point rack. My hunting partner Jose Ramos says the rack on the deer I shot was bigger than six or eight points. There are pieces of bone and antler on the ground from where the deer fell and hit the ground. The pieces are cracked and broken. The pieces look eroded, and have holes in them. I talk with Franco Ramos, another hunting partner, who says he could have hit that deer. I tell him he couldn't have hit the deer from where he was, on the edge of the field near the other woods. I show him where his shot ended up and where mine did, which is about 50 yards apart. His shot would have had to been about 200 yards. He accepts that I was the one who hit the deer."

It is a big hill, and people start sliding at different heights, or points, on the way up the hill. I don't want to go all the way to the top. I slide down the hill from a point that is pretty high up, but I slide really slow and stop before I get to the base of the hill. I jokingly whine about the slide. A woman who seems to be a conglomerate of an acquaintance named Mary Phelps and a classmate of mine from Brimson named Heather come and jump on me. A man I know from Brimson named John comes and picks up my glove or mitten. It is dark green in color. I quickly grab it out of his hand. My friend Hilary Nano is there. She tries to assure John, who is mad at me, that the reason I took the glove was because I was nervous."

He is Darla's fiance. He drove some kind of vehicle with golf carts in it or on a trailer. I look out the window and see a cart with its motor running and no one driving it. It is moving and crashing into the cars that are lined up on both sides of the street. My friend Esther Thurman and my roommate Stephen Ramos are there. Stephen drove a Tracker, while Esther drove her parent's truck. I take the running golf cart and toss it in the back of the man's vehicle. I go and tell people to move their cars, which are in a line, all smashed into one another."

I take my pair of black underwear and try to put them on. I spin them on my finger for a bit, twirling them. I get them on, and go back to the man for my other clothes. The man is about to sell my clothes. I quickly say that I'll give him money, but then I beat him, kicking him in the groin and taking my clothes. From then on, he is younger, and he is after me for revenge. I leave. I am with the group of students that are in my traveling class. We go to a place numbered 50 on a city map. The man I beat up is still pursuing me. Outside the airport is a scruffy young man. He asks me, \"Would you care for psychology?\" He has a thick accent. At first I don't understand him. Then I realize he wants to talk about psychology, and I say yes.I am in a mall-like area. There is a place called The Cosmopolitan, which is a small shop. It is early in the morning, and the shop is only serving beverages. My friend Yvette Ullman is there. I walk through the mall area and go into a bookstore. I walk around the counter and look at two men my age working there. I stare them down, comparing myself to them. I go look at some out of date Christmas cards and calendars, even though they are out of date. I walk in the mall, and see my old roommate Jens Nils. I say hi to him unenthusiastically. He and a group of three or four people are wearing colorful body garbs that come from a year-round Halloween shop in the mall. I see my high school classmate Brett Ball and say an unenthusiastic \"hi\". There is a display case in the mall with a few Darryl Strawberry baseball cards in it. There is nothing else in the case. There is a card that used to be of great value. It was priced at $9.75 now. The man working said he would have to check to make sure that the card is really that cheap.I'm in a house or room with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. I am eating broccoli. The broccoli is disgusting and I spit it out. My mom asks why I spit it out, and I say I hate raw broccoli. There are vegetable dips there. I have a slice of flabby broccoli, like a thick broccoli fillet. I don't eat it. My mom points out that there are carrots, and I eat those. A kid drives by in a truck. He honks and waves his hands out the window trying to get one of my sister's attentions. My sisters and I talk about some young kid. I tell him where I saw him last, but I forget the name of the place. I start saying what I think the name sounds like, and eventually one of my sisters guesses the name \"Cosmopolitan\", which I remember to be correct. A male police officer brings three young boys to the back door of our house. I meet them as I go out. The officer says to me that these three boys told him that I've been farting in places like basketball practice, or basketball games, which is a crime. I speak to the three boys and say that's right: I have been farting. I say there is nothing wrong with farting: it is an entirely natural thing. They disprove of my viewpoint, because of socialization. The officer lets me continue speaking. I speak until I am finished, and then go back inside. The officer doesn't stop me because I have argued my point well. I get inside and see my friend Esther Thurman and my old girlfriend Annie Thomas. I am surprised! I am slightly angry that the police officer bothered me. Esther tries to grab my hand a couple times, but I pull it away. I do this both because I am angry with the officer, and because Annie is there. Annie is wearing tight brown pants and big brown leather hiking boots. One of them is wearing a big puffy yellow jacket.I'm in bed at the Manhatten Hotel in Sydney, Australia. I've told my roommate Niles Zelling the part of this dream where the man asks me, \"Would you care for psychology?\" Niles comes over and sits on my bed. He is excited. He knows what this part of my dream means. I think about it, and realize its meaning, and tell him it confirms my decision to major in psychology. He says I am exactly right. Then he looks ahead to our future plans of our \"dream machine\". He recalls our dream interpretation group in personality class, in which He says I did a good job, though I know I didn't."

There is 1:02 left in the first quarter break. The team is warming up. My dad is out on the court with them. He is goofing off: tossing a ball between his legs and demonstrating a hook shot. There is a bridge-like walkway over the court about 30 feet high. I walk up and across it. The band members are playing on the walkway. My dad is talking with the players, making fun of them. I am very mad that my dad has been doing all this with the players. I yell at him and tell him that he's hurting the players. He does his goofy smile/grin and chuckles, not taking me seriously. I am very mad at him. I tell him, using the words \"big man\" and \"little man\", that whenever we converse and I want him to take me seriously, he doesn't. When he wants me to take him seriously, I do. \"Big man\" is the one who wants to be serious. \"Little man\" is the one who won't be serious. Coach Jackson Shooter comes up to me and says, \"Stop yelling at your dad and help Ben\". He is annoyed with my behavior, and thinks I am being selfish. He thinks I'm being selfish. I say to my dad again, \"You're hurting the players.\" One of the players, Travis Kulik, is sick. A player who may be Andy Klien, but who has more facial hair, walks by. He does a handshake with my dad. Another player, Ryan Barnes, is there in street clothes."

There is a road going up the hill. A car drives past us going up the hill. We walk towards the road. We see a coyote on a grassy mound on top of the hill. We notice it because it howls. There are stairs where the road was, and we take the stairs up. We get to the top of the hill. There is farmland on the other side of the hill. Farmers are singing in a foreign language as they drive a big 8-wheel machine over a field of hay. The farmers leave. Norman, I, and others go into town, where we will wait for Nat and someone else that have gotten a late start on their way up the hill. I go into a store and buy a bottle of Clearly Canadian. I look at water in bottles, and notice it is expensive. Another group of college students is there. The farmers were actually foreign people, and may be part of the group. The group seems older than us. People are outside smoking. I go outside with my Clearly Canadian and pretend to play the \"air drums\". It is raining. I have a white Styrofoam cup. When I open the bottle of Clearly Canadian it foams and sprays out. I put my mouth over the top of the bottle, sucking on the foam spraying out, until the pressure is released. I am having a pretty good time with my Clearly Canadian out in the rain pretending to play the air drums. There is a skateboarder in the road. He is going fast down the middle of the road."

I try to help the couple get a photograph of it by holding the fish for them. I drop the fish! It is in the water. We are in the water up to my chest. I pick the fish up out of the water. It is a good-sized pike: between seven and nine pounds, I estimate. I lose the fish again, dropping it in the water. I'm using my friend Kevin Simpson's telescoping fishing rod. I feel guilty that I dropped these people's fish. I case into the trees, in the woods, and on shore. I don't do this on purpose. The handle on my rod and the crank on my reel are broken.

As the dream goes on, I lose the knowledge that this is a television show, and it seems real: Two tiny UFO's are flying in Montana, in the country. The UFO's do a loop-de-loop and fly through the windows of a big brown house. The windows break. They fly though the woods. They go past a tree. There is a shotgun tied to the trunk of the tree pointing upwards. When a UFO goes over the gun, it fires and blows up the UFO, which is about as big as a football. I see the gun clearly: I look down the barrel. There is an investigation by a team, including a man named Ross and a lead woman, and possibly another woman. A squirrel was blown to bits by the shotgun, not a UFO. The investigation group can't tell what it is. It is all moldy and rotten. It was splattered all over by the blast. The group figures the squirrel was running full speed when the blast occurred. There is an evergreen branch that had the tips rounded off in the blast. This demonstrates that the squirrel was running full speed when it was shot. People come to guard the \"thing\", the investigation. There is one woman and three men there. They are dressed with yellow clothes on. The woman has a sword. The others may too. Two men are in a pool with others. They are arguing over tape measures. One man yells at another and says they should agree on what a yard is. This man suggests a yard is \"two inches, one-quarter inch, and three-eighths of an inch.\""

I get a bag for the minnow and find some water. I don't put any oxygen in the bag. I twist the bag up to tie a knot and the minnow is in the twisted part of the bag. I untwist the bag and redo this. We are driving a truck that is not mine. It seems to be Stephen's truck. There is a Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler magazine on the rack in the store. I take a Hustler magazine, intending to steal it. I watch for hidden cameras as I do this. When I look at it I see it is all white paper with no photographs.

Our classmate Ryan Walker and another man are in the truck. The second man reminds me of a classmate at Brimson, but also of the Chinese man from the movie Say Anything. I put the minnow in the back of the truck in a small metal minnow bucket. The bucket tips over and the water runs out. I think I will not have a live minnow to use. There are four jiggle sticks and rods. They are in the spare tire in the truck. We have just the essentials for fishing. Stephen and I talk with George. We ask if he does much fishing.

Stephen is in the passenger seat. I get into the drivers seat. The vehicle is a stick shift. It is Stephen's truck. I drive on Main Street. There is construction on the road I take as it leads out of town. I back up down Slope Avenue and we wait for our friend Bubba Hacker. Bubba jumps into the bed of the truck, which is a regular cab pickup now. I think that he will be cold in the bed. I get on Main Street going out of town. The road splits.

We walk towards the back of church. We are unsure of where to go or what to do. It is hot. Father Vance Brock is the priest. I see him in the back of church as we walk back. There are very few people in the congregation, probably no more than seven or eight in all. In the back of church are Tim's mother Mary Robbins, and another man who may be an usher. There are some one-gallon apple juice jugs on the floor. They are being rolled around or moved, maybe by my younger neighbors Alan and Ricky Broud. I move swiftly down to the entryway at the base of the stops and place the jugs on a table so they don't break. I hurry to get back up to the entrance aisle because the procession is starting. There are a few young girls carrying things in the procession ahead of us. I hurry to catch up with Tim and then slow to match his pace. We have trouble walking at the same pace: I walk slower than he does. When Tim and I get to the altar I wait for Father Vance to get there before we all genuflect. Tim genuflects as soon as we get there. We get up to our chairs. I am holding the book that Father Vance reads from. I shake and tremble as I hold the book. Father Vance says he has something that will help me with the shaking. I have a white shirt on, which his unbuttoned far and slightly falling off my right shoulder. I feel queasy. I lean and fall over, and then sit. I leave the altar area and go back to the sacristy. My aunt Nisa Redding comes back to see if I am okay. She has two tiny dogs that are less than a foot long. One of the dogs is about _ pound. It has a skinny tail, about four or five inches long. My grade school classmate, Misty Ryan, takes my place serving the mass. I see the back of her head as she slips into the robe and walks out of the sacristy. Father Vance, who seems to be my dad, comes back to the sacristy. He has some sort of incense, which may be the kind that is used in funerals, in a clump, in an incense burner. He, who is my dad at this point, says that my mom died last night.

I'm putting air into the tires of my brown Toyota Camry. My grade school friend Todd Hinz is there with his brother Chad. Someone introduces us like we are strangers, but we know each other. I say hi and we talk. Todd is working at a printing business in Wilmerton. He tells me of a certain kind of printer or printing. I am familiar with it. I say printing is Wilmerton's biggest industry. As I am trying to put air into the tire, the air spout collapses and recedes back into the tire. My bicycle now has low air pressure in both tires. I tell Todd to look me up when we're home. I tell him it will be under my mom's name, Natalie Redding, in the phone book. I am near the city of Hillston. I'm trying to find a route back to town. I am in a very wooded area on the outer edges of town. There is a river there and some hills or mountains. I am lost. My classmates Kyle Mendelson and Kelsey Bobber help me to an underground tunnel. I saw them and decided to yell. They wouldn't have helped me if I didn't yell. They have a torch. They lead me to the house of my academic advisor Mary Monroe. My roommate takes me down some stairs. He says that an acquaintance of mine, Mary Phelps, has not given up on me."

I cast about 20 yards out but realize I could have gotten it there a lot easier by going to the opposite shoreline. The cast landed about five yards from the other shore. The big yellow fly I am using is very near the other shore. A fish hits the fly. It is a huge largemouth bass, which is fighting well. I think it looks like about 10 pounds! My mom is holding the rod. I scramble to grab the net. My dad is there, and picks up the fish without a net. I'm worried it might get off the line, but it doesn't. I hold the fish. It is not a very big fish, maybe a pound and a half."

I flush the toilet, which has already been flushing. Some urine and feces get on the floor. I pick them up and put them back in the sink, and rinse my hands.

Everyone leaves quickly. I take my time getting dressed. I grab my gloves, hat, and backpack, and then leave. I am going to wear a towel around my waist, over my pants. I go out into the hallway. I see my old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens and her friend, wearing bikinis. People are trying to get out of the dorm using stairways, doors, hallways, and other passages. Not all the people make it out. I make it out. People open doors for me. I'm going down hallways like those in Holy Middle School. Some of the route I take is clandestine. The tunnels end up at a disco ballroom, where we are free from the chase of the police."

I say, \"It's all about ceramic toilet bowls.\" Rusty says, \"It's all about licking heads.\" He licks my head, and then Sheila's. We all have dinner. I open a box wrapped with green paper after dinner. There are some dessert bars inside. I eat one. It crumbles as I try to eat it. The box was supposed to go to my aunt Raquel Redding. It had my mom Natie's name on it, short for Natalie, so I thought it was for my mom. She wouldn't mind if I opened it. Rusty, Sheila, my mom, and others see that I opened it. This is a terrible thing for me to do. I wasn't supposed to open the box. There is no way to repack the box. People are mad at me. I feel guilty and shameful. My sister Ramona washes the dishes, though she doesn't want to. I'm in my room upstairs at home. Rich and I might play chess. Rusty comes up also. Something happens with stuffing a closet. I'm then in the kitchen. I'm drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and taking some garbage out to the garage. Someone comments on my smoking a cigarette. I say I've only smoked 10 cigarettes in my life. An ash from the cigarette lands on the gas tank of the lawnmower. The lawnmower explodes. I run into the kitchen and close the door. There are several loud bangs and explosions. A fire breaks out. People come quickly with fire extinguishers. There was a direct telephone line to the police or fire department so they will be coming even though the fire has been put out."

There is a woman and a child. They sled down an icy hill onto snow and up to where I am. The woman sends her child before her on a tiny sled. Then she follows. They go fast and become airborne after a bump, and then crash into the snow. The snow I am on collapses. I fall through down into a narrow gulch or ravine: a big crevice. I manage to climb up a little ways. When I get to the top I yell at the woman to move away from the edge of the unsafe snow. She doesn't move, and we both fall down. It is cramped rock area with snow. We slide down a long ways. I am with my classmate Bryan Beard. We go to the setup area for the rescue plane. The area is a big hanger. We need to move a big platform that we are on to the big door and attach it. The platform moves, kind of floating. We try to get it into position. I fall out of the platform and hang onto the big door, grasping a lock. The platform moves back around and I jump in. The plane is there. Bryan and I have paper towels. We must hold the roll of paper towels to wrap around the propellers of the plane. It is a last resort. We don't have many options. I hold the tube of the towels with my fingers in each end. The end of the towel is wrapped around the propeller. It turns slowly. Before I know it the towel is unraveled. It didn't help the propeller much."

I lay across the front seat with my head in her lap. She backs the Bronco up. There is a skunk on the side of the road. The skunk is spraying a thick golden-yellow syrup-like liquid out of its backside. A car stops behind us, maybe because of the skunk, or because we're backing very near to the road. Jackie wants to talk, as we start driving. She says we should have dinner Monday night. I tell her my feelings again. She kisses me, hard. She straddles me and kisses me, ignoring the road!

I think it's not scary going over the water, but rather it is cool. I do think the 90-degree turns are scary. We are leaving. I look at a newspaper in the gas station. There is a huge photograph on the front page of a man with a 100-foot python. He doesn't want the python to eat his horse or other farm animal. We leave. Wally is driving. I'm in the passenger seat. My mom and my sisters Ramona and Heather are in the back seat. When we are actually driving, my mom is in the driver's seat and a couple in their late 20's is in the passenger seat. I am behind the couple in the back seat. I don't know who they are or why they are there. I don't want them to be there. White lights go on in the rear of the vehicle signaling there is something wrong with the rear brakes. I have a map. I try to figure out where we are and where we're going.

I ask why not stay at Grandpa's, since we're here? I don't want the couple to be with us. We pull of the highway on the exit ramp slowly. The exit ends.

There is a wooden post with some colored bottles on the side of it. I easily break the post off. It has the words \"Biochemical Health Hazard\" on it. I hold it up to everyone and tell, say \"Look!\", and then disgustedly tell them to get out of there. There is as stream next to the post. The stream is the health hazard.

That was a test cast for her. She is holding the line in her hand, on a spool of fishing line. We are on the water. I take of my glove-mittens and throw them to a third girl who is in the water. I grab the rod, which is in the water. I tell her to let out a lot of line, because I know the fish will break the line coming from the spool since there is no flexibility. I connect the line with all its slack to the rod, which doesn't have a reel. I get washed in towards shore as I start to wind the line around the spool of thread. I feel the weeds on my body, but I am clothed, so it's not as aversive a feeling. A big wave comes and washes over me. I am washed up, now on the shore. I follow the fishing line. The fish is on the end of it: a nice-sized northern pike. It is still hooked. I cheer! Matt and another person are there. Matt takes the fish and lets it go at the shoreline. I am happy. It is dark. I remember I forgot to pick up Matt. Wally or Matt lends me a quarter and I go to Sandwhich Heaven to call Matt. Matt's brother Jasper answers the phone. He tells me Matt knows I forgot, and he wanted a confirmation call. He had driven out to the lake and will hope to meet us by the shore. I go back to the lake. Matt is swimming in the water with a man named Bobby whom I know through a friend from Brimson, and his friends. I'm in a large, nice boat with an inboard motor. Matt is driving the boat. We bump into some boats that are docked. There is a party-like atmosphere. I am on an object that may be a jet ski, in the water. I bounce on this object, going down to the bottom of the water, to a cement pool-like bottom. Then I shoot up out of the water 10 or 12 feet into the air. Once I squish my classmate Kyle Mendelson between the object and the cement floor. I squish his head. My cousins Bertha Strange, Archie Weber, and Ramona had their faces photographed in one of those circus items where the bodies are painted on a board and the heads are cut out. There is a photograph of me looking like a goofball and making my funny noises. There is a photograph of my friend Niles Zelling. My classmate Sarah Pauly is singing Karoke. I walk on the floor of the lake/pool with my eyes open. I poke Kyle in the shoulder. He is scared of me because I hurt him earlier. I push off the bottom and get to the surface for air. I am standing on a platform above the water. I decide to take paleontology for a grade rather than Pass/Fail. My classmate Shawn or Ryan Bay is on a similar platform, and decides to take a class Pass/Fail. I slide down a pole. I am going down a lattice-like ladder. The water looks like a lake in some respects."

It's a crowded airport. I don't think I have all the necessary papers and passport, but I do. I go through the pass gate. The lady asks me how long I'm staying. The woman next to me says 10 feet. I say 10 feet. Then I realize the inappropriateness of that answer, so I say 10 feet and 10 days, joking around. The woman charges me $26 for my stay. I move to pay for the bill, and since I don't have enough cash I put it on my MasterCard. While I'm paying, someone comes up to the lady that is helping me and shows her a photograph of her jogging with a neck brace on. My friend Tim Zelling wants to look at hacky sacks to buy. I say okay. I don't have much money, and I owe money on my MasterCard."

My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are my roommates too. I meet some of the other employees. They are older than I, and larger. Mike looks different than I pictured: taller and scruffier. There is a lake nearby. One guy starts up a boat with a motor and makes a small circle before docking again. Someone seems to control the boat from shore. The controller seems to have a mini boat next to the shore, which goes in a small circle next to shore, and also controls the movement of the larger boat. They want me to start the motorboat. The boat is like an alpine sliding cart, made of plastic. I try to start it. There is long rope connecting the sled and I with the boat. I sink in the plastic \"boat\". I get help from people that live there. There is a heavy crosswind, like being on a river. I can't grip the handle, which is like the stock of a gun. Then I grip it well and the engine starts. I'm in the plastic sled and I can't make the boat move. There are loons and a bald eagle there. There is a group of canoeists on a trip singing and playing guitar. The mosquitoes and the slugs are really bad. I am wearing a yellow rain suit when I go to start the boat. I walk in the water and don't get wet except through the collar. A man I work with is carrying a girl out of the water. I am taking the rope out. The man gets pushed under the water a bit."

He has me step into two plastic bags and strap the bags to the pack. He says it will be easier to carry. I find difficult to walk like this: I can't take a full stride. Wally has a briefcase-like pack, which I put on. He will give it to me. There is a woman there. I pick up a pair of red rubber rain pants with rubber stocking feet. I turn the pants inside out, then inside in. I look at the fishing gear on the wall. There is no good fishing line. There is a huge spool of pink and yellow fly-fishing line. There's a lot of old fishing gear, one of my dad's big cork bobbers, and a lot of jiggle sticks. My aunt Willow Redding's friend Paul is there. I ask him if he had a good time at the Brimson Picnic. He says there was too much meat there: nothing to eat. He sys he didn't have a piece of the Caber, which is the hog. One or two cameras fall off the little shelf. I pick up one of the cameras and start taking photographs. I use a tiny one-inch by three-quarter inch camera. There are two orange, brown, and gold hawks or eagles flying about in the sky, fluttering and losing feathers. My uncle Dannie Redding is there. He walks towards the birds and whistles, holding out his arm. One bird lands on his arm. The other bird he picks up from the side of a telephone pole. He sets the birds down on the ground. One of the eagles gives birth to a young eagle, and then a second, and a third. There are no eggs, and the young are rather large. They are wet and slimy when they emerge from the mother, but quickly become dry and fluffy. They are about the size of the older birds, but puffier."

I am in awe of its huge and massive size. On a smaller peak next to it I see a ski lift and ski slopes. I am so excited! I am happy and I cheer and think that we are going to have so much fun! I am skiing with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. There are three boxes of cereal and two gallons of milk, one of which is 2%, where we are staying. The milk hasn't been refrigerated and is warm and sour. We seem to be in Australia. There are many lifts to go up the hill on. There is a power quad lift. We go up on a lift. There are then no chairs for the lift, which is a rope or cable that we're hanging on to. It keeps going up with no end in sight. We might not be able to get off. There is another lift near where we are. We are low to the ground. I ask the guys if we should just jump off and go to the other lift. My dad is there. He tells me to wrap the cable around the metal pole that is holding the cable up, so the cable will stop moving. I do this by pulling myself up and stretching and wrapping the cable around the pole. Tension builds as the cable is pulled tighter, without snapping. My coworker Shawn Tryner is there. I tell him to watch out or he could get hurt when the cable snaps. I go up a lift and ski down in deep, powdery snow. Another man is there. I have just gone down an area that I picture to be like Corbet's Coulier in Jackson Hole. The man says something about \"frag\" or a ___, which are puffy snow sculptures of these images on top of the four or five feet of existing snow. He says how he likes how he likes one better, or how one is easier to wipe out or kill. I go through a brick tunnel, past a loading area, to another ski lift. I go past my friend Melanie McDyss, who is waiting for a ski lift. I talk to my friend Norman Noman, who is by the ski lift. It is almost 2:00 pm, and I say I'll meet him down by the chalet for lunch after my next run down. Where we are, part of the slope is grassy. I go to the lift line. I have a snowboard attached to my left foot. I wait, and a young woman comes around me in line. I get on the lift with a woman. We don't talk for a while. Then I say, \"How ya doing today?\" I slur my speech a little bit. I think she is about my age. She replies to my question. I realize she is an older woman, 50 or 60 years old. I didn't realize this earlier. We ride up. There is snow in places and grass in others. It is warm and the snow is slushy. Cows are out on the slopes sitting and grazing. We get to the top. I get off the lift and can't move well because I'm on grass. I had been carrying my skis up in my hand by their tips. I am holding a show chunk that I scooped out of a snow bank on the way up the hill. I want to throw it at a cow, but the woman is there and she would think I'm cruel if I do that. The lady skis well when we get off the lift, even though there is no snow. My classmate Kyle Mendelson is there, wearing roller blades instead of skis. The snow is melting on top of the mountain, and there is a lot of grass. People are looking for a snowy area to ski down the mountain. I have no poles. It is hard for me to move on flat land at the top. There is a frozen lake that we go over. I go by a shed with many brooms and dustpans in it. I think of using the broom handles as poles. Some men talk about going to Brisbane to get out, and finding a Celtc, which I understand to be a road."

I am in a locker room with a man who is looking for my friend Niles Zelling because he wants to hurt Niles. I pretend to help the man, but I really help Niles. The man is dumb. I talk loud so Niles can hear us coming and hide. At one pint the dumb man and I actually pass Niles when we are walking."

My high school classmate Muriah Dinks is there. She chases me around flirtatiously. I escape from her into a bathroom. I urinate for a long time. There is the threat of her entering the bathroom because she knows I'm the only person in it. In a smaller group two people are naked and are having sex in an odd position."

I am with Kevin in a canoe near river water. My high school classmate's father Gary Lind is there. I talk with Kevin about the Big Resort Area and about the trip. I say it will be two weeks: September 1st- whenever, and we'll go from Woodsville to the Backcountry Highway. He is skeptical about the trip. We leave and kick paddle our canoes back to a house. We do this by leaning our legs out the back end of the canoes while lying on our stomachs, and kicking. We get to the house. Kevin's father Dilbert Simpson is there. He scolds us for kicking our canoes past Gary. He says Gary was fishing and we shouldn't have disturbed him. We walk up the shore a little ways. Kevin nods and says yes, accepting what his father has to say. I tell Dilbert off. I say it makes no difference whether he is fishing or not. Kevin is standing there wishing I would shut up and shaking his head as if to say, \"No! Don't say it!\" But I go on. I say to Dilbert, \"Whether you are grilling and a boat goes by, who cares? I don't like you! You are cold and impersonal. One can turn to you for any work problem: to fix a boat, car, wall, or anything, but not to deal with people.\" Dilbert is agitated but remains poised. He says, \"I'll borrow a phrase\", as if he is too good to use normal language. He says, \"I'm pissed off!\" He is mad at me. I say to him, \"Kiss my ass! I don't give a fuck what you think or feel! You don't know crap!\" Dilbert is flabbergasted. He is hurt and speechless. He says nothing in the wake of my angry venting. There is nothing he can say. Kevin is hurt too. He doesn't want me to talk this way.I go to my truck in the alley at home in Oak Valley. It is dark outside. There is a yellow car behind me as I go down the alley hill. The truck moves before I start it. I put it in 2nd gear when I do start it because I'm already moving. Dilbert and Kevin are inside my house saying goodbye. They are about to leave. I'm in front of the house with my mom, sister Ramona, uncle Rusty Redding, and my cousin Melvin Redding. I am going back to the Big Resort Area. It is my day off. I shake hands with Rusty, saying goodbye. My car is a green Volkswagen Beetle with a trailer attached. There is a clip missing for the windshield wiper on the passenger side. Rusty adjusts the clip that is on the driver's side windshield wiper. My mom and I share a hug and kiss. I kiss her on the cheek and on the lips. This is strange: I haven't ever kissed mom on the lips. It feels almost incestuous, uncomfortable. I tell them I've got a lot of driving to do for a tired guy, and that I'll get some caffeine when I get gas. I ask my mom to stay and talk with me a bit before I leave. She does, and the others leave. I tell her about Kevin and what happened with he and Dilbert. I am upset over this. Ramona is there. I let her stay and listen to us talk: who cares if she is there, I think. I start to drive very slowly. I say I've got to do some work on that dream, recognizing that what happened with Kevin and Dilbert was a dream. I start to cry. I stop the car on Home Avenue. I yell out loud and cry! It is very emotional for me. I leave the car there. I have a strong need to work on the dream. I quickly say to my mom to take care of the car. I run back home to work on the dream.

I know it is a bomb. I run and hide next to the red brick wall separating my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard and the adjacent house. I crouch down and cover myself. There are many atomic bombs dropping all over. One bomb lands in the back yard of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. I am running by when it hits.

She isn't there and I talk to her sister Jessica. Jessica says Annie is leaving soon. She is rude on the phone, as if Annie is too good to talk to me on the phone. My brother Wally is going to Australia. I'm with my parents. We're leaving at the same time as the last trip to Australia: 11:00am. It is 9:30am now. It takes one and a half hours to get to the airport, because we're in Wilmerton. I have not yet packed, and am not prepared for the trip at all. I've waiting until the last minute thinking I've done this before and it's no big deal. I run with my dad to get ready. I have him pack near the inside corner of the L-shaped building where I live, which may be a school. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer runs along side of me. I'm in a job employment office. It turns out that we leave at 5:00pm, not 11:00am. I look for my name on a card, to get some information about the flights. My cousin Rich Redding is going. I talk to a man about a job. He knows I am interested in sleep and dreams. My classmate Rebecca, from Brimson, is there. I have a long thin line of burned skin on my left arm. It is like a scar, but it is raised up. I'm at home, and the answering machine is flashing indicating eight messages. Wally is there and is all packed up. He tells me to check message number 11 on the machine. My mom's voice recorded the outgoing message, which I hear. On it, she confuses Wally and I, mixing up what we are doing in our lives. I'm with my mom. We are walking and talking in a large house. My aunt Sheila Redding is there watching television. I am sleeping in a room. It may be the night before we leave. My dream notebook is full of holes from a pen when I awaken! I am very angry when I see this! I tell my mom, and explain I want to use these dreams for a book. She comments, but seems not to care, implying I can have more dreams and use those dreams."

I get two packages of photographs. My package costs $17, and my roommate Sean Williams' costs $3. I am very surprised at this.

Since I am dreaming I pick up a picnic table and try to break it in half. At first I can't do this, but then I do. I think I should be more productive in my dream, so I fly.

I offer words of advice, which are well taken. There is a black man in a green suit in front of me. There is some odd black stitching on the collar of his suit. There are two women next to me that are vigorously taking notes. People are talking about education.

The spirit of the crowd is reluctance at first, and then everyone starts throwing money in. I think if we divided up the money per person it would be more than five dollars each. I throw in the two one-dollar bills that are in my wallet, but not the five or 20-dollar bill. I put my one-dollar bills on a stack of money, which is ordered so that the largest bills are on the top and the smallest on the bottom. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I seem to be at Carter Elementary School. I am wearing only white briefs underwear. I walk down the north stairway, trying to look physically fit: not flabby with stretched out underwear. I go into the bathroom by Billie's Daycare. I am going to defecate. My high school classmate Mya Rousing comes into the bathroom. She says my name and tells me that she has vomited into the toilet. She says this like she needs help, like this is her weakness and she has given in to it. I sit on the toilet and fart. Mya hears this. Then I fart more quietly. I am full of gas. My high school classmates Carmen and Harmony Allure are there. Harmony has kissed a track runner from Bell College named Moab, who I think of as the track runner I know from Brimson named Paul. I come out of the stall. My high school friend Tiny Combs is there. He is naked, and facing away from me. I see his butt and butt hole. There is a pig in the bathroom. It is small and has muddy feet. My foot is bleeding like it has been cut on the bottom. I explain this in some other way."

I shoot a lot of gang members. I get shot from behind, and I say to the person who shot me that I'm already dead! I feel nothing. I'm in a building with others. I'm in a room with two people. We're supposed to watch a movie, which we go to do. I have seen it before, I say. The movie is not that good. In the movie, there is fake blood on a dead person."

The candles by the altar are burning out; there is no wick left. I'm wearing a green and white sweater that is too short for me. My white t-shirt shows from underneath the sweater. I have on a pair of jeans and tennis shoes. Back in the sacristy I change into and orange and white striped shirt with an orange windbreaker over it, and tan colored pants with boots. Fathers Dan Pink and Vance Brock are presiding. I see them in the sacristy. I get an extra long robe to wear. The sizes on the robes have a three-digit number. My number may be 267. My brother Wally is at church but doesn't help serve. I play the Bare Naked Ladies or Grant Lee Buffalo in a cassette player over the speakers in church before mass starts. When I shut the music off, my sister Ramona goes up and starts playing the piano as the introduction to mass. I go out the south side door, running to get back by the time she is done playing piano. I go through the basement and the kitchen. Items for baking are set out. I'll come by later and get something to eat. I go up the back stairs to the sacristy. One sign reads \"Construction\". The hallways lead to a hospital and other places. I have trouble finding the sacristy. I find it: it leads to or is a gymnasium. It's full of people. My mom, Ramona, Wally, sister Heather, aunt Sheila Redding, uncle Rusty Redding, and their kids Melvin, Melissa, and Rich are there shooting free throws in some sort of a game or contest. I'm outside Carter School. We get 24 large metal cans delivered on two trucks. I carry two cans at a time on my shoulders to exercise my back muscles. My boss Phoebe Mills may be there telling me where to put things. I haul the cans to the old equipment/ball room. The trucks that left the barrels also left some wet, dirty equipment packs for us, from the dump. I hang them above the Thermarests in the equipment room at Fishing Haven. One man driving the truck wants out glass for recycling. There is some outside and some in the equipment room. My friend Tom Napper is there with a big dog. It wants to go outside again, and Tom is annoyed with it. I'm back in the old equipment/ball room. Some people who are seniors in high school have submarined the room, messing it up. The room is half full of balloons. I try to pop them with a torch, which doesn't work well. Then I pop them with a scissors, so we'll see and take class. The school is empty. There is a mail jeep with a red and blue stripe parked outside. I find some chocolate ice cream in a refrigerator down where the first grade coat area is. I run with the ice cream. I'm going to eat it or put it in the freezer. I go through the gymnasium. The door to he music room is open. I get down near the north end of the building on the lower level where the freezer is. My third grade teacher Liza Minikel is there cleaning. I hid the ice cream on the side of my body, and run down the hall towards the main doors. She doesn't see the ice cream, and must think I'm strange for running. Ramona sees me and chases me. I fake going out the back door to the playground by pushing it open, so she would hear it, then hiding around the sliding gymnasium door. I laugh as I go up the stairs, and she knows it's me. I don't fool her, and she comes into the gymnasium. She is wearing a bra and full brief underwear. She asks me if I like them. They seem scrunched up: vertically compressed."

She sits on my fat erection, and we have sex. She leans back against me, her back against my chest, and my erection slips out of her vagina. I put it back in. I ejaculate semen all over. Something happens with my sister Ramona's aqua colored watch. I may ejaculate on it. I have no pleasure when I ejaculate. I masturbate in the bathroom to get the pleasurable sensation of ejaculating. Water is overflowing from the sink onto the floor."

Mike makes me take my ultralite rod too. I walk by my high school friend Tina Totts in the forest area where the cabins are. She asks me about her eyebrow clipper, as if I have it and she wants it back. I see or am in a scene where people are sledding. It is winter and the hills are covered with snow. People go fast down hills on different types of sleds. One man does a nice jump. I walk through a trough-like stream of icy water. I go into a bathroom in a building.

I hold and hug her as we lay on my bed. She stands and takes off her shirt. I push her up against a wall and kiss her, hard. I kneel while she stands. She starts to give me fellatio, and I lay down. She puts my hand on my erection, to have me stroke it as she sucks. I say my penis probably tastes bad, from the sweat from the play. She says it doesn't. I lose my erection. I gently stroke her vagina with my fingers. She shudders, I think in pleasure. She says, \"Please don't hurt me.\" My penis becomes erect again. I flip her over onto her back, put her legs up, and penetrate her. I move her on the bed and keep thrusting. I thrust deeper and deeper each time. She is on her back on the edge of the bed and I am kneeling on the floor. It is uncomfortable for her. I am close to ejaculating. She is in pain. I pull my erection out, and tell her to give me fellatio because I'm about to come. She is in pain, and doesn't do this. I ejaculate weakly on her, on my sleeping bag, and on an open beer bottle."

It has a body like a crappie but has a big head and tail. I walk up the ramp way, then hop over another ramp above it. The ramps are slanted, like a switchback. I let the little muskie go down a slide-like black tube with water in it. It slides down. That is how one releases a muskie here. I am walking and I see my grade school classmate Helen Vader. She has really changed. I remember when I last saw her at the fair and told her that she had really changed. I don't say that now. She has chin-length straight blond hair and is wearing a lot of makeup, including lots of pink blush. We talk a little bit. She is going to school in Forkville. I see her mother Doreen Vader and wave at her. Doreen doesn't recognize me. The area is crowded with both fishermen and non-fishermen. I notice my aunt Sheila Redding and cousin Rich are standing next to me on my left. I turn and say hi to them. My uncle Rusty is there too. Sheila sees or hears my friends coming. I look down the walkway and see my friends Kevin Simpson, Bubba Hacker, Stephen Ramos, and Tony Kramer coming to fish! I yell to them my greeting, \"Sluuu!\" They come over to where I am. Tony bumps me hard when we meet. I'm not sure this is friendly or belligerent. We go to fish muskies. I walk past a swimming pool in which I see a northern pike chases a kid's spoon lure and hit it. The boy catches the fish. My big muskie lure gets caught in Tony's green sweatshirt. He gets the hook out and throws it to me. Not wanting to catch the lure, I let it land. The metal lip on the lure gets bent. I swear! I think I put the lip of the lure in my mouth, like a mouthpiece. My classmate from Brimson Ed Yarns is there. I go downstairs to where we get in. A man operates this place. It is a tourist place. I jump over some parts of the stairs onto another set of stairs. All the rules for the place are posted. People come and pay for time to fish here. I have my yellow spoon and two huge plugs. My high school classmate Jack Miller has the plugs in his life vest. The man is going to charge me $2 to use the spoon and $3 for some sort of permit. He says that the fishing will damage the rainbow trout population, and that's why I have to pay the fee. I say I'm not fishing for trout, I'm fishing for muskies, but he says it doesn't matter. Kevin comes down to the man and I. He doesn't have the other two lures. It would cost more to bring those in. I don't' way to may that much, and I leave. I go up to the man to get my yellow spoon, and the man tries to keep mine and give me a cheap version that looks like mine! I get angry with him and call him a fraud. I tell him I'll expose him! He quickly covers up his name on the boxes and things that are around so I don't see his name and tell others bad things about him. His name has five letters, starts with K, and contains the letters l, e, and i in it as well. I leave and go upstairs, walking out of the place. There is a very attractive young woman sitting at a table with others. She reminds me of an attractive young female customer we had at work recently. She looks at me briefly. I catch her off guard as I walk by. I can tell she is attracted to me. I walk out of the place, tossing a crumpled up piece of paper at a garbage can and missing. I don't stop to pick it up, and feel like a fool because the attractive woman may have seen my do this. I am walking in a mall. There is a bar there. I think of stopping to get a beer.

I haven't seen her in a while, and she has longer hair. I go up to her and she doesn't talk to me. Another woman assists me. I want to put something on my credit card, when I had actually written a check for it. Then Sara speaks to me. She is holding a grudge against me: she says I'm a ____ (the equivalent of an asshole or a fucker). The woman that is assisting me says something. I decide to play the asshole role that Sara says I am, so I tell the woman to shut the fuck up. I say to Sara, \"You know how I am: I mean no offense\", implying that she has no reason to hold a grudge against me. She changes her attitude towards me and gives me a piece of paper that says Happy Birthday Kenneth. We seem to get along fine then, and she is her smiling self."

She instructs Ramona and I as to what we should do, because she is experienced. We hurry. We are to put the chicken, hot dogs, bratwursts, and potatoes in a cooler. We are bringing these to the hospital with a big pot, to cook them. I get ready. I bring a whole small chicken. I get dressed. My friend Jerry Pasons and my roommate Sean Williams from Fishing Haven are in my room sleeping. Sean then goes to urinate. Jerry is still sleeping, and rolls over onto Sean's bed.I'm at the hospital. My brother Wally is there. I grip my mom's hand while she squeezes my hand back. Wally just found out that my dad is the father of the baby. I have known this for a while, and am not happy about it. I am afraid of what will happen, and what we'll see: my mom's vagina! I eat a cheeseburger with tomato, bacon, and cheese.I'm swimming with my friend Kevin Simpson. We have life jackets or seat cushions on so we float around. We are in very deep water, like an ocean. We swim and dive under the surface, having fun. My high school classmates Sam Poll and Karl Mueller think we are diving for lake trout. I play with a full can of gas, which floats. There is a little red house underwater. Some very big and tall weeds come up from extremely deep water. I have fins on my feet, and I swim above the tips of the weeds, underwater. I swim down towards the red house. There is a woman near the house. I seem to be able to breath underwater. I jump from the ground or roof of the house. I go a long ways with one spring of my legs, like there is less gravity, though I am underwater. There is a black funnel that falls or sinks quickly past the house. I go after it quickly. It lands on the surface of some water, which is underwater. I swim very fast with my flippers, as if it is important, and swoop down and pick the funnel up. I swoop upwards, flying, and lucid, realizing I am dreaming. I try not to wake up. I focus on the area around a tree. I fly around it. I think I may fly through the ground, going under and through it, and then coming up, like either the ground or I am intangible. I try to make my ex-girlfriend Annie appear in the tree area so we can have sex. I try to have sex with something-anything, even the ground."

I say I have a chunk of something slimy in my crotch from masturbating earlier. I think I have female genitals. They feel warm and slimy. I'm at home near the front driveway. A person licks my vagina, and it feels good. Then I am inside the house and have male genitalia. I'm having sex with a woman on a piano bench.

Lisa is inside. She must not hear us at the door. I go around back and Lisa is relaxing in a rocking chair. She says the door is open. I open a screen door in the back and enter just as my dad gets the door open. He needs to urinate frequently and pays close attention to the color, time, and salt in his urine. He is sick. My brother Wally and sisters Heather and Ramona are there. We're upstairs in a room. My dad is downstairs. I look at a book of CD's, many of which have skulls and dead people-like monsters on their covers. We look at Ramona's yearbook which has photographs and movie-like clips of Wally and I.

My dad is outside in his old blue workshop where he used to live, in the storage portion of it on the left side. He is urinating. He was planning a charter-fishing trip to Lake Erie in August. My siblings and I don't know what is wrong with him, or what is happening with his illness. I feel sad and guilty that I don't know, because he is my dad. I want to know what is going on with him. I go downstairs. He has just urinated, and is washing his hands. I ask him what is wrong. He says he's decided not to go on the fishing trip because of his health. While I am sad about this, it is actually okay because I'll have more time to myself. He tells me about some sores that have developed around his mouth and nose. He says the doctor says they can be taken care of with medication. I feel that he is sugar coating it, and not dealing seriously with the problem. I walk around the house, which is nice and big. I see an electronic typewriter. My dad is frying two big fish fillets. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. He is filleting or frying fish too. I eat a bite of fish that has a bone in it that is a whole spinal column with ribs. I think it would be a terrible and painful way to die, for my dad to have trouble with his urinary tract.

We get there. There is a deli-like place where I can get a turkey sandwich, which I want to do. They woman there has people fill out a form, like a menu. I have to get back in line though I was there before some of the other people in line. It takes a long time! I sit on an area covered with small rocks. I woman sits, waiting, next to me. The woman at the food bar has a Nin_ car. I tell the woman we're not waiting! I'm mad that its taken so long. I grab two pink sheets and look at them to fill them out. I say if she really wants us to fill them out we will. There are boxes with letters next to them. One needs to check the boxes. A woman there falls over, like she is fainting. I immediately go over to her. I yell for someone to call 911! I talk to her. She can breathe. She can hear me. She has a cramp-like symptom. She is the sister of a woman I met at a party last night named Kirsten Peters. I yell for an ambulance. It seems that she will be okay. I'm outside Mason Cafeteria at Brimson, but where I helped the woman looks like I'm outside Carter School. The table where the deli woman was is gone. It was down by the \"Bowling\" sign near Billie's Daycare. I hope I can get back in since I've been outside with the woman."

My childhood friend Andy Jones is there with a woman who works here on some kind of project. They need to get into the bathroom, which is like a storage room as well. They interrupt me as I'm trying to defecate. I get up and leave, and they do what they need. I grab my stuff, and some garbage and walk out towards Carter School. A rock star that is a young kid with dyed red hair is playing in the church. People are setting up chairs as I leave. One man says that they need six more chairs, and indicates he wants me to help. I'm not going to help because I have nothing to do with what they're doing. I see a woman on my way to the recess door of the school. She asks me what I'm doing with Fishing Haven's garbage. I realize I'm carrying it, and I tell her that I'm in the habit of it, even though I recognize that I don't work at Fishing Haven anymore. I feel dumb saying this, and I want to get rid of the garbage, especially before my former bosses Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills see me! I walk over to the parking lot behind Carter School. I need somewhere to put the garbage. I go into a door below the steps and put the garbage into a can in the gymnasium. My truck is parked outside next to Fishing Haven's blue truck. My friend Beth Mock is driving the other truck. It's full of wood for building, which is from something that was dismantled. I think it looks like there are some maps of the Big Resort Area in back. When I look, there are not. I get into the truck with Beth. She tells me she's reading some letters to kill time before she goes to the dump. I think I should tell her she should go and just drive slowly, rather than sit here where she may be seen. Beth expresses her dislike for her job at Fishing Haven. We go to the dump. We go past a liquor store. My birthday comes up in conversation, since I'm now 21. We pass Francois' Restaurant, which is a huge liquor store. I say we should go there, and want to stop. We pass a police car. I tell Beth to keep her speed under 38 miles per hour because police will give tickets for anything more than that. She doesn't listen. I put my seat belt on in case we're pulled over. We drive to the dump, which is out on the Thru Highway, but we don't go that way. We are with other friends going to a concert. It's snowing. Something attached to her boot pulls Beth along the ground. I kneel in a red plastic sled and push myself along. We are then on 1st Street between Hill and Slope Avenues, in Oak Valley, on the south side of the road. We hear songs on the radio station 101.7 which Beth says are the same songs that are going to be played at a dance show that is happening tonight. I think this is the same thing we're going to. We move on the ground. There are tickets and wristband scraps all over the sidewalk and ground. Two older men leave the concert/festivity. They have wristbands on. I don't' have a ticket to this. Michael Jackson will be at the show dancing. I'd like to see him rather than just sitting and doing nothing. My cousin Archie Weber is by the Elgins house on the southeast corner of the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. He tells me to pull off to the sidewalk. I do. There are broken sunglasses on the ground, but none that are good enough to wear. Archie is checking for a parking space near there which is why he wants me to wait."

We are afraid of the grizzly bear outside the back door, which is my ex-roommate Sean Williams. I take the weapon, which is like a prodder, and tell the others to take rakes.

My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is a server for the mass. The priest is Father Vance Brock. At the end of mass Father Vance asks if anyone wants to stay and serve a funeral. A lot of people raise their hands or jump up, because they'll get out of the rest of the day at Carter School if they serve. I hope I don't get called on. Father Vance selects three people, not me. Then he tells the rest of us \"cocksuckers\" to leave. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there. I grab his jacket for him. Outside is it icy: very slippery. Others and I go over to Carter School. We haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's early afternoon. My friends Tiny and Matt Combs, and Jeff and Ryan Vaurnet are there. They're going to Jefferson School to have a fish fry for lunch in a trailer home. I haven't eaten since I've been in church, so I ask them if I can go with if they'll have enough fish. They say I can. I go upstairs to the secretary's office where I find a television and a VCR. I unplug them to go past them, and then plug them back in. I walk down the dark upstairs hallway with a light in my hand. The doors to the classrooms aren't closed tightly. I don't know which grade I'm in. I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack. The coat rack of an acquaintance of mine named Debbie Oliver is next to mine. Debbie and Sherry Devine walk out of the room. Debbie is starting 6th grade at Carter School. Sherry has some very crisp waffles. She says I can go eat with the others. The others have left."

I'm getting set up with a woman who is a friend of a female friend of mine. I sit up and talk with my friend, and the woman comes. There is a lot going unspoken. The woman and I are supposed to have a sexual encounter in a dream. She may not want to do this. She is attracted to me, but may not want to have a sexual encounter with me because I do that in my dreams. The woman has blond hair and her name is Lucy. She is talkative and kind of annoying. She reminds me of my classmate Rachel Thompson. I sit up to talk. I make an attempt to be social and go through the courting process, though I am not comfortable doing so. We're outside a bar. There are some men from Brimson there who recognize me. They are baseball players. I vaguely recognize them and say hi. One of them looks like my classmate John Thomas. The man from Brimson that I met in the Big Resort Area at Fishing Haven is there, and I say hi to him. There are other people outside the bar are giving away dead fish beer and eating raw fish. Some of the fish have a huge eye on their side. There is a white limousine with baseball players in it parked nearby. Another white limousine being driven by a drunken baseball player crashes into the parked limousine. I think that the crash will cost a lot. I walk with Lucy down metal grate steps of what seems to be a baseball stadium. I ask her if she writes down her dreams. She says yes, and I am surprised! I tell her I have 10 dream journals full of dreams. We buy pizza. Fist we go to one little shop where it costs a lot and the employee is rude. Then we go to another shop. The pizza costs $1 a slice. Then it is two slices for $1. I ask the man if I can exchange half a slice for a piece, since it's two for $1. The pizza that is $1 a slice tastes good. The pizza that is two slices for $1 isn't very good: thin, unmelted cheese, and small. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. He talks about an eye mask that he wears which enhances vision.

We pull in and the place looks different. I see that the towboat dock has moved. A man I worked with, Tom Olson, tells me that they now get off work at 4:00pm all the time. I go in the store. There are new employees there. They seem tame: like mindless suckers. I go back to the office to get my mail. I think Phoebe is there. As I walk back, Mike comes in the front door and walks back towards the office. I ask him for my mail. He goes into the office to get it. He fakes tossing a yellow stringer in a package at me, then picks up a new leech locker. He says I really put Gene and Marie in a bad situation. By this he means that I really treated them badly. I don't know what he is talking about. He pulls out a small tape measure and measures the distance above the door to the office, wall to wall. I tell him I don't know what he's talking about, and that he should tell me what he means because I'm sure there's an explanation for it because I've never done anything wrong or bad to Gene and Marie. He says it's about a Mad River catalog. I understand him to be implying that I stole the catalog. Gene, Marie, Mike, and Phoebe all think I stole it. I go berserk! I didn't take the catalog. Phoebe says that maybe I \"extendedly borrowed\" the catalog, using a euphemism for theft. I tell them angrily and firmly that I didn't take their catalog and if they think I did they can kiss my ass! My former coworker Amy Rancher is there. She says, \"Yeah, Kenneth... You're on a roll!\" She is proud of me for saying what I thought. I'm not putting up with these people's crap. I tell them straight out that I didn't take anything, period!

There is a white cloth hanging from the top of the doorway with brown writing on it. The writing advertises sales in the store. I go in and meet Phoebe and ask her for my mail. She jokes about what I wrote in my letter to them. She says I wrote that I should \"get payment\" rather than \"receive payment\", which to her would be saying that I should pay. She understood what I meant, though, and will pay me. I go to their office, which is smaller and not as nice looking. She gives me a $100 bill and an extra $20, a big sheet of stamps, and a little sheet of four stamps. Then she says something about not coming back here or to Lakeville with Morris (a moose), or Doris (a duck), or Boris (a bear). I think she is telling me not to ever come on Fishing Haven property again. But then she says that people have been leading the animals back here. I laugh, and say, \"Okay, I won't\". I tell them we're going out on Eagle Lake. Knowing there are no permits for the Big Resort Area, they ask if we're going to Lakeland National Forest. I make a quick recovery and say yes, which implies that we won't go off Eagle Lake into the Big Resort Area and that we aren't camping. One of the men in our group comes up behind me. I don't recognize him at first, but then I do and introduce him to Phoebe and Mike ad my cousin Darren King. They say they'll probably come check on us. I know this is to make sure that we don't go anywhere without a permit, and that they are being sticklers. I hate this about them, but don't say anything. I leave and walk out to the road through trees and on grass, like an apple orchard. My brother Wally is with me. We run back to the car at the Eagle public landing.

I slide down a steep cliff and catch my footing on the bottom of the rock race, right next to the water. I toss the canoe in. I think it may have floated away then, because I can't see it. I ask a man if it floated away. He says, \"No, it's right here.\", and motions to the side of the dock he's standing on. I put the canoe to the side for now. I go through a short tunnel which is the portage. I hear a man talking about this portage, and if he's been here before. He doesn't mention Evergreen, so I think I'm not at the Evergreen portage.

He then pulls a pan of sausages over, implying they are geared towards women as well. I laugh. I understand what the man is trying to do: sell a better newspaper. But he is fundamentally wrong.

I'm talking to the lesbian woman I met at Fishing Haven who stayed in a cabin near mine, and a man who may be her father. I'm talking about where to camp and what to bring. They both pull out cash to tip me. The woman walks over and puts $10 in my left front pants pocket. I'm wearing my cream colored corduroy pants. I watch my mom and one of my siblings chase a rabbit in the snow. My mom grabs a clump of snow where the rabbit would be, and it runs. My sisters Heather and Ramona and my dad see a big brown dog in a tree. They chase it. It goes from tree to tree. I run home to get my gun. It is a .22 caliber rifle, but has characteristics of a shotgun and a BB gun. My mom says Grandpa Redding is getting married to Ramona, who I know is Grandma Redding. It's for their anniversary. Heather has a case of Schlitz beer. My mom is going to a meeting at Carter School. The people there won't want me shooting. They are meeting at Felix Sand's house, across the street from my house. I say that the shooting will not take long. I go out and ask my dad, Heather, and Ramona where the squirrel is that they've been chasing. They point to a branch of the tree that used to have the old swing on it. I brace my gun on the tree and aim. I'm shaky. I see though the scope that it is a squirrel and a little monkey. I fire and hit it directly in the stomach. It falls to the ground. I shoot more when I get close to it, not steadied on a tree. I see the BB's fly by the animal, not hitting it. There is a little dead monkey lying on the ground in the front yard. Heather grabs her beer and puts it in my dad's car, which is also my uncle Rusty Redding's car. Heather wants me to wait, but I go inside."

        "dream_content": "150 Tons of PressureI'm in a boat with my friend's father Franco Ramos and a man my age. Franco and I are fishing. We're trolling along with landing nets in the water, with the net handle attached to the boat. We catch trout and salmon like this. When the net bends back that means you've got a fish, so you jerk the net like one would set the hook and pull the net and the fish in. We catch many fish, some of which are big! We pull one in every few seconds, as fast as we can. I think Franco catches a walleye, and then I see it is a salmon. He lets the other man fish. The boat starts to veer off course. I turn the throttle down and keep it on course. The fish have dark eyes. Something happens to a stringer we are using. We come up to a 94-foot long semi truck trailer. The stringer is being attached to it. I am under the trailer by the middle wheels. Someone is by the back wheels too. I'm scared and nervous. I feel like I'm strapped to the bottom of the trailer. I feel the weight of the trailer on my back and legs as the driver hooks it up. We are hooking up another trailer, weighing 150 tons. I'm really anxious. I see the semi truck back up and the trailer creaks because of its immense weight and pressure. I get hooked up. I squeeze out of where I am and go around the back of the trailer where the driver is. There is a Greyhound bus there. People on the bus come out dressed in winter clothes like they are cold. The driver tells me he wants me to keep riding under the trailer. There is a set of wheels that he drops down a notch; they are closer to the ground now, almost touching. This will give me more room. He tells me I have to learn how to drive the bus that he is driving and that I'm under. He is in a bad mood: sick and tired of driving. I tell him no problem, if he'll teach I'll drive. I realize when I say this that I legally probably shouldn't' be driving a bus full of people. If anything happens, he'll be liable."

It is, and I see four immature eagles perched on it. I ask Archie where we're going. He says to Idaho. I think he's joking.

I look on the white sheet and there is a note that has something to do with me. I ask my boss Phoebe Mills what it is for. She points to a purple bag that is in the locker at the desk. The bag has my name on it. She tells me some books of mine are there. I look next to the back and pull out my Historical Geology book, \"On Dreams\" by Sigmund Freud, and a brown file folder with copies of my 1996 tax returns in it. I walk out back and into the driveway with my friend Jerry Parsons. There are red gas cans all over, like the six-gallon gas can I bought for my truck. The cans are full of gas. I go over to the towboats with two gas cans, one of which I've taken the cap off of. The customers look like they're ready to go so I put the cans down and put the cap back on the one. My boss Mike Hollow is coming over, and I feel like I shouldn't have the cap off it. There are two women getting tows. There is one woman and one canoe in each boat. One canoe is black. Tom is driving the boat on the right, with the more attractive of the two women. He warms up his motor. The woman in my boat moves back and warms up the motor. The boat drifts back towards shore, and I think the prop may hit the lake bottom so I move the boat forward a bit. Everyone is ready to go, but I need to grab a flannel shirt for the ride. Tom says he'll drive my boat out to the end of the dock so it will be ready to go. I run up and grab a shirt. I run back on the big dock, past Gene and Marie, and get into the boat. Gene and Marie know that I've quit. I think they look down on me for it, but I don't care: I know what I'm doing, and am competent. I set the boat cushion on top of the red seat that is in the boat. I can't pull-start the engine. It is in neutral, and the cord is really hard to pull! I try to start it but I can't. I find the choke and open it by flipping a switch halfway. I pull the cord and the motor doesn't start. I open the choke all the way by moving the switch to the left. The motor is square and much larger than the one I'm used to using. I get it started. My high school classmate John Kulik walks out on the dock. He knows I'm there. I pull the boat away from the dock, ignoring him. We leave. Near the opening to the bay Tom's boat slows down and stops. I see the brake lights for his boat and the cars in front of it. I can't stop in time without hitting his boat, so I pull of to the right of his boat onto the shore. I hop out of the boat with one foot. The motor is still running, but I don't think it has hit the lake bottom. I push the boat along easily with one foot. I'm in a sandy area. People are there. We get off track a bit, and will need to find the trail since we got off course."

My high school classmates Olie Kecker, Brett Ball, and Arnie Heller walk in. They look down upon us because they think they're cooler than us: we are two different crowds. I greet Olie half-heartedly by saying, \"What's happening?\" Gino goes down to the other apartment. I don't want to be in these people's company so I leave quickly. I'm wearing socks but no shoes. I hurry down the stairs outside: I don't want anyone to know I'm leaving. I look for my truck, but can't see it at first. I'm not sure where I parked. I walk down the road to find it. There is a very pale woman with whitish blond hair who calls me over and tells me that back near or at the apartment there is a cat that got nailed down. I think I should go help it. I see my truck. I'm going to get my truck and go back to help the cat. The woman says she's going to go help the cat, so I run for my truck to leave so I'm not near the apartment. The woman runs after me. I stop and turn around. I'm confused, startled, nervous, and scared about why she is following me. I don't know why she would follow me. I realize I must be dreaming. I punch a yellow truck. Instead of my hand going through the truck, as I expected, it hits the truck. I tell the woman she is a part of my dream and ask her what she represents. She doesn't answer. She becomes a spirit: non-tangible but visible. I engulf her, consuming her, integrating her. I walk on and see my mom. I tell her she is in my dream and ask what part of the dream she represents. She doesn't answer. I engulf her, consuming her, as well. I see three women. We are on the hill of 1st Street just west of Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I stalk them, taking my time, poised. I ask them what they represent in my dream. When they do not answer, I consume them."

There is a small difference in price between what I want to buy and my credit. I pick up coins that are scattered on a workbench with other junk. I can get enough money from the coins to pay. An employee talks to me. He says Jeremy Taylor was here a few weeks ago. I say \"No way! He's one of my favorite authors!\" I realize he's actually not one of my favorite authors but still is someone I would have liked to meet. It seems like the place is a bookstore. I walk towards the back of the store. I'm looking for a room. I may have something that needs to be put in the room. There is a sexual connotation for this room. I go near one room, which I realize to be too extreme and perverted for my sexual taste, so I keep walking. I get to another room, which is too extreme as well, involving kinky fetish purposes. I'm looking for the tamest of all the rooms, with maybe just pornography or something. A dog goes by me. At first I'm happy to see it. It is a pretty light tan colored dog with short hair and a long tail that it wags. Then I see the dog is on a small platform that moves by itself. The dog is permanently attached to the platform by its feet. The butt and rear end of the dog is brownish, and I know humans have repeatedly raped the dog, which is why it's attached to the platform. The platform moves in a set path around the place. I think it's usually in one of the perverted rooms."

I'm on the ice, or the boy is I. We go in line and do a drill, zigzagging across the ice. I don't have skates on. I jump up as high as I can and try to touch the rafters. At the end of the drill I do better, and I kick a puck in a goal with my skate. I go off the ice. The hockey coach is the short girls assistant basketball coach at Armstrong High School. I don't like him. I say to him, \"Fuck you!\" He gets right next to me, and we argue. I quit. I punch him. He says he should punch me. I tell him if he punches me I'll sue. He punches or slaps me, but I'm not bothering to do anything about it. I walk across the rink wearing my shoes to get my stuff to leave. I have a locker with my stuff in it. My high school classmates Binky Ahmed, Olie Kecker, Arnie Heller, and Brett Ball are there. The coach is near me. I tell Binky his dream is about \"being filled with hot air\" from the coach! Binky is friendly to me. He asks me what I've been doing since I've been back. I tell him I've been reading, pretty much from the time I go to bed until the time I get up. Then I realize I said that backwards: it's actually from the time I get up until the time I go to bed, but everyone knows what I mean. The other guys think I'm pretty much worthless for reading all the time. They don't understand me. Olie maintains respect for me. Binky asks when I'm home, and I tell him always. I leave the arena. I leave my friend Bubba Hacker's red and silver Coca-Cola jacket in the locker. I exit and there are all kinds of forklifts and men carrying bricks, trees, and plants around. It's crowded and chaotic. My friend from high school Sam Kingsley is there. I shake his hand and we talk. I toss my stuff in my truck. Sam says it took him a while to figure out the handles on the truck. We're at his vehicle. His family is there, but I don't recognize them. He has his senior photographs. There is only one or two of him, and they are all very fuzzy. The rest of the photographs are of small children. Sam is going on a vacation, on a 12-hour drive. I tell him to call and give me his phone number. I go back to the truck, which seems to be a maroon mini-van like Fishing Haven's mini-van. I see that Sam got into the truck through the window, which is rolled down halfway, and then unlocked the door. I know he went for a ride and put gas in the truck, because there is more gas now then there was before."

Then I realize that it was a dream: it makes so much more sense that way, it's so much clearer. To justify myself I say, \"In the dream...\", and then catch myself and say, \"In reality... this is where people were\", and I start pointing out different places where everyone was at.

Jenny introduces the woman and I. Her name is Kari Johnson. I say to Kari, nonchalantly, \"Didn't we sit next to each other in 7th grade?\" She says that we did. I tell her I had a dream a couple weeks ago about our 7th grade classmate Kelly Furlong. Kari thinks I am dreaming about Kelly because I'm attracted to her. She doesn't understand what a dream means to me.In this place there is a disagreement and arguing over an accident or a fight: who is guilty, who is to blame? People gather inside the place. There is tension. My friend Kevin Simpson is there and talks about guilt. He doesn't blame himself, which I think is unusual because he's always sacrificing himself. Instead he blames my brother Wally. I think that though the fault lies somewhere, much of this should go blameless. The situation arose because of the circumstances, for which no one is to blame. My friend Stephen Ramos is outside. I go outside to avoid the conflict. I listen through the window, but don't want anyone to know I'm listening. I try to sneak back around front without them knowing I was eavesdropping. Inside there is a small crowd. My dad is there. I imagine a fight. I would support my dad if someone started trouble with him: someone would have to deal with me first, and I consider myself to carry a considerable amount of strength and power. There are two yellow school buses on the corner near the place where we are. One bus is rolling towards the other. Someone yells for me to put a package or a bunch of cheap white razors in a hold on the inside of the front of the moving bus, so when the buses collide they will explode. I run into the bus, put the razors in the hold, and quickly exit the bus. Main Street in Wilmerton is packed with cars. The police arrive, driving their cars on the median. The place we are at seems to be the glass store near McDonalds. I walk west on Main Street. I want to get away so that the police don't question me about the incident. I walk in my underwear. My face is scarred and torn up. Men are crowding the sidewalks and street. This seems to be a Men's Fest. Many of the men are holding a can of beer. There is a man hitting baseballs on the St. Mary's Church field. All the men are supposed to get to do this. They walk across Main Street and traffic stops. There are a few thousand men. I walk through them. I don't want to be a part of Men's Fest. I see pencil drawings on white paper as I walk. Some of these are large. Most of the drawings are of men and women. I know I had a drawing done, but I don't' know with who or where it is now. As I walk the back of my underwear may drop down, exposing my butt. I want to be away, to escape the police. I think of different routes I can take. Cutting through yards is probably the most clandestine route. I think it will be difficult cutting across the Thru Highway out in the open: the police would see me."

I wonder if it will be in anyone's way, but Nat says the only person coming through is ___(I forget her name), the night cleaning lady. We leave the shop. I see my friend Kevin Simpson, who has really short hair. He works at the hospital. To have some fun, he leads us down a stairway to the basement where we exit out of a garage door into a parking lot area between buildings. We need to shut the garage door. Tom is close to it, but is too short, so I go back and close it. Kevin leads us to another building for which he has the key. Five security lights go on outside the building as we approach it. We scramble for cover, but not too frantically. I lean up against a wall to get out of the open. Tom runs away. Kevin, Nat, and I go into the building. We go up stairs and down hallways, just running around. We see security guards coming in their cars. It is now the daytime. I'm in front of the others. We scramble down stairs. Kevin directs me, but I don't know all the doors. We get to the first floor and go out the door on the other end of the building. We decide if security catches us we're going to say we're friends of a friend of a friend. We walk away, and go by huge tree stumps that are tan and white in color."

I point out to her that there is a white shirt inside a dark green shirt, so she doesn't wash them together. My grade school classmate Patrick Bergman comes up to me and says he is there with his buddies and they will kick my ass if I go near his table. I don't bother to go near him. I sit alone on a picnic table in back of the shack, and am content with this. I'm talking to my high school teammate Binky Ahmed and Olie Kecker about parties. Olie wants to have three big parties. I tell him we're not having them at my house: I've already had my big parties, and am not having another. I may have a party if I get an apartment. Binky will have a party."

Usually the men's room is on the right and the women's is on the left. I see my grade school secretary Angie Sacks go into the bathroom on the right, so I look above the doorway to see how they are labeled. I go into the men's room, which is on the left. There are showers with a wall obscuring the shower stalls. A hallway is visible. I seem to be at Brimson. Women are in the bathroom. My grade school classmate Annette Smith is defecating in a stall without a door. My classmate at Brimson Laura Robinson is urinating in a stall. I think that's odd sine she is a woman, but maybe she has a penis. I urinate in a stall. I wash my hands well afterward with soap and water. A person is putting a small ball of garbage in the trashcan. The ball has some red stuff on it, which I think may be menstrual blood, and I find that aversive. Angie Sacks and my brother's grade school classmate Shelly Jenson are in the bathroom. I walk out past the showers and get a glimpse of Shelly and my classmate Sarah Miller standing, drying off after a shower. I try to do a task separating two wife beater tank tops and something else, but I can't do it or I have trouble. I walk out of the bathroom. My grade school classmates Kari Otis and Misty Ryan walk towards me. Misty is telling Kari about some of her dreams. They are joking around, and we joke and playfully punch each other. Kari then punches Misty hard in the face, which is inconsistent with the playing that had been occurring: it was malicious! Misty is hurt, and taken back. Kari apologizes to Misty, but it is not a genuine apology. Kari is mad and was expressing real anger and aggression in that punch. My high school classmate Linus Doman is there. I say that Kari punching Misty hard would be like me punching Linus. I have a pair of glasses with lenses five or six inches in diameter. They are candy, and I try to eat them. The glasses are so big they'd be more easily eaten if they were in pieces. I go into a class on sex roles, which seems to have something to do with my economics professor Zoe Madden. I walk in and sit down behind my friend Matt Yams. People behind me try to bully me, and I ignore them. The male teacher is collecting books and blue papers. I don't have my work done. I didn't have the same work done at an earlier class period. I woman I recently met is in the class."

        "dream_content": "The Snarkel DreamI'm in a big city. There is a very tall hotel with many stories. Off the side of the hotel quite high up is a platform that extends 25 or 30 out from the building. It is all enclosed and finished off. This is Alcatraz. The platform has a satellite dish on it, pointing upwards. It sends out small waves and gets the waves back when they are larger. The platform ledge is used for high-class business or social functions. In the building there is a large round elevator with a hole in the middle: donut shaped. People stand where the cake part of the donut would be. The elevator is about 70 feet in diameter and holds a couple hundred people. It goes up and down many floors of the building very fast, but gently.I am in a round green room. There is a woman there on the other side of the room, and others. The class of 1997 from Brimson is in the elevator, and they enter the room we are in from a metal hatch door on the floor. They walk up and in like the elevator is below the room we are in. Alec Johnson is among them. He talks to another woman about Josh Lanky, my high school classmate. Alec says that Josh is a good guy. The class is going to watch a movie in the room. A woman I know comes up to me and says I have to move because the class will be sitting where I am. I hop off the table I'm sitting on and she sits down there. I realize that this exact scenario of the woman telling me to move has happened to me previously in a dream. In that dream I told the woman to eat shit, and wouldn't move. In this case, I moved. I go sit by the woman I know. The room doesn't fill up: not all the graduates come. The areas near the walls are occupied but the center of the circular room is largely empty. The people and I watch a movie on a big screen. My friend Tiny Combs is there. In the movie there is a black man who gets electrocuted and dies. He is digging, mining, and connects two wires together. The two other free ends of the wires touch his feet, completing a circuit, and he gets shocked. He is alive later, and a woman straddles him; they have sex.There is a round brick vertical tunnel about 10 feet in diameter. Next to the tunnel is a ledge. There are some metal bars extending both out from and across the tunnel. There is a round concrete platform, about two feet in diameter, that moves up and down in the tunnel. I am hanging on the bars. My friends Tiny and Nate Nelling are there, also hanging. We have to let go of the bar, land on the platform, ride it a little ways, and then jump and grab onto the bar again. There is a snarkel there. The snarkel is a little man who lives in this deep, dark tunnel. The tunnel is very deep and dark. At the bottom the tunnel curves and becomes horizontal: the tunnel is actually U-shaped. It may go back up on another side. The snarkel says that he fell to the bottom of the tunnel once. It took one and a half years for the platform to come down so he could jump on it. At the bottom of the tunnel, at the bottom of the U-shape, there is a light. The rest of the tunnel is dark. The platform will make it to the bottom sometime, but we don't know when. The platform moves where it needs to go, where people need to go. One needs to jump on it while its' moving. My friend Tim Zelling is there. We hang on the bars. Someone tries to use a fishing net to help me and one of the other guys move from the bar that we're hanging on, like we are supposed to step in the net or onto the metal edges of the net. The net isn't strong, though, and it won't hold. I want to jump from the bar, pushing off from the wall with my feet and legs, and land on the ledge without using the platform. This is dangerous. I might not make it and would fall down into the deep dark stone tunnel. I get ready to jump. I tell Tim not to grab me too soon or I'll lose the jumping momentum. I'm aiming for a metal support bar on the corner of the ledge. I hope I can jump and grab onto it! I have to be careful when I jump not to hit my head on another bar farther out in the tunnel."

I go out into the large, wide hallway. There are many doors. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to go into. I walk down the hallway, looking into rooms. One room is large and empty: classroom-like, and has religious artifacts around it. I wonder if it's a good idea to ejaculate in that room. I'm near the end of the hallway. I see my friend Simon Naver walk by, around the corner. He sees me and after pausing, he comes over and we talk a little bit. We shake hands: I don't get a good grip. I ask him how much money he made this summer, because I hear he made a lot. He says he made $9,000! We talk, but are uncomfortable doing so. Our high school teammate Tony Kramer may be there. I leave, and walk back down the hall to the office area. There are several famous movie stars in a room: a man and a couple women. A woman was raped earlier, though she didn't realize it.

A man trolls along the shore of the lake, about 50 feet out from shore. His fishing lure drags really close to the shore: one or two feet. He's using a baby torpedo lure, I see. I ask him if it's a tiny or a baby torpedo, even though I know what it is, just to make conversation. He stops and talks to me, saying it's a baby torpedo. He is trolling for bass. He uses the name ____ (I forget) instead of bass, which is unique. I think there probably aren't many bass in this lake. It's a very clear lake, and the depth drops off from shore really fast with little shallow shoreline for bass. He says that a thunderstorm is supposed to move in shortly, tonight or tomorrow, and after that we're supposed to get clear weather until it cools off this fall. I think that's good news because I want sun when we're in the Big Resort Area. I am in a basement with the man and my friend Hank Anderson. We talk about moving a wall back for more space.

He finds our orientation, and we head southeast, to make a loop in the time we have. We're using his Grumman canoe. There are two yellow canoes ahead of us that make it to the portage before us. We go past the Jordan portage to the Lora portage. It's 90 rods long. The water we cross is turbulent. I carry the canoe on the portage. The yoke is very close to the back of the canoe and my view is obstructed by the back seat. I say to Kevin that we forgot the bent-shaft paddles! A man at the portage tries to drag two aluminum canoes by putting the bows of each on each of his shoulders and driving his legs. I pass this man, running carrying our canoe, which is really light. We come to an open area. I am leading with the canoe. Kevin follows, with a younger kid and a man in his party. They want to take a photograph of me because I handle the Grumman like it's a feather, even running with it. I stop for them to take a photograph.

Our team doesn't have enough players, so the other team has some of their players play for our team. There is a goal on each end of the field. After the first game we're supposed to play a second game. Niles questions whether this is a good idea because we have a basketball game later that day, and he thinks we'll have more Frisbee games later as well when our players show up, because we'll keep winning (as if it's a tournament). My high school classmate Buck Green shows up for out team's second game. We play. The other team kicks off. I receive the kick off, which is a football. I catch it in a fishing net after it bounces, and sloppily throw the net and ball to Niles, who is behind me, when the other team approaches. A tall red-haired man that I know from Brimson defends me, and I defend him. The other team then has the Frisbee. I hold the man, giving him cheap shots, the whole game. While I do this I ask him if there is a rule against holding, even though I know there is. He says there is a rule, but it's not called holding, rather _____ (I forget). When we get the Frisbee he defends me cleanly and very well. He is a very good player, much better than myself. The other team scores easily. It seems I am only on offense at the first kickoff, and then am on defense the whole time. They have the Frisbee on the sidelines for a throw-in. The player I'm guarding, who is my former roommate Sean Williams, rolls an entry pass instead of throwing the Frisbee to his teammate. The Frisbee rolls like a wheel. Sean and I both chase it. He is faster than I, and picks it up. I chase him. There is no one between him and the goal, but he is still a ways from the goal. He is going for the goal, and will probably make it. I dive when he throws the Frisbee, trying to deflect it with my outstretched arm. (I awaken with my right arm outstretched hitting the fan on my floor.)"

We're trying to pry open a cabinet that is stuck closed. We fiddle with the key, and can't get it to fit exactly. We use a crow bar and have to position it nearly perfectly in the slot, but do and pry the door open. Beer is inside. We all say yum! We hug each other. Hilary is in the middle and Niles and I are on the outside in our 3-person hug. I pretend to have butt sex with Hilary. There is some sexual feeling in our interaction. There is a box of envelopes in the cabinet. Tim Zelling is there and takes a 12-pack of Miller Genuine Draft bottles out of the cabinet for him. There wouldn't be much left, and the owner would know that we took some, so I leave the rest there. We all walk down lofty stairs, which are built to one can see between the steps. My old roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens are walking down the stairs as well. They heard our \"Ummm, beer\" chant when we opened the cabinet. Many people now head back to the hall to hear music that has been playing there, and to take part in it. I'm in a crowd of students waiting to re-enter the building. We all sing, on cue, at appropriate times. The first line we sing is pretty clear for having so many people singing. The next cue is all jumbled and incoherent. People get in groups and do the hokey pokey. I wonder why they do it the way the do: holding their arms up, bent, touching one hand to the opposite elbow. My sister Ramona, my mom, and my friend Kevin Simpson are there. We're in a circle with others. Ramona does the hokey pokey in the middle and then comes over to me, which means it's my turn to go in the middle. I laugh at this because it's funny, but I also am hesitant to dance like this: I feel embarrassed and self-conscious. I fall down laughing, then slide on my back like Michael J. Fox's character Marty in the movie Back To The Future. No one really likes my dance. Kevin is next. He moves a stone on the floor with his head, and then kicks it to me. I kick it back.

I think I am a long way off the floor. When I hang down, I am only a foot or two above the floor. I let go, and easily land on the floor."

The teacher is like my calculus teacher from Brimson but is more mellow, easier, and geekier. Sue and I are the only two students in the room. We get assigned to do our choice of odd or even problems from the book. The teacher didn't instruct us on how to do them, just to do them. We are having a class meeting on Wednesday, and the problems are due Friday. Sue and I look at the problems. She is wearing a short gray cotton skirt with a pair of white spandex biker shorts underneath. I wish she wouldn't have worn the spandex under her skirt! The problems in the book have boxes with circles in them. Depending on where the boxes and circles are, they are symbols for addition and multiplication. Sue and I flirt, and I want to kiss her. At one point I walk down the hallway and see other classrooms. My classroom is much more laid back then the others: they are all working hard. The problems look like this: ___=_, where squares and circles represent different numbers and operations:10 _ 10_10     10"

Some of the younger adult men court a young woman there. There is a conflict between the younger and older people about noise violations. The older people think the younger people are loud, and the younger people think the older people are loud. A person who went to my high school, Karin Bellview, is there, or the head of a puppet that reminds me of her is there. The red headed-man I caught chickens with is there. He has a goatee. I think of driving home and how much I've had to drink: what my blood-alcohol level would be. I figure I have only had three beers: two in the first hour, so if the police stop me I won't get at DWI, but rather a DUI. I think of getting a DUI on my way home: would I pull over or try to outrun the police officer? I imagine duping the police. When I get home I see a loaf of bread in the driveway when I get out of the car. On the bread my mom has written $1.25. I go inside and my mom is finishing baking cookies.

I pour some oatmeal for myself. I ask if Holly got some oatmeal. She says yes, she did, but says so hesitantly so that I think she really didn't get any, but isn't saying so. My brother's friend Mryle Madden is there. He chews Skoal. It's winter, and is snowy and icy on Home Avenue. I'm a senior at Armstrong High School.

He can give me a ride or I'll walk or just skip school. I'm outside by the back driveway. I see a bunch of cars brake quickly and slide on the slippery road as they start to go down the hill on Home Avenue. The cars crash into each other, rear-ending the car in front of them. I ask a girl form my high school, Rachel Ransom, if I can get a ride to school with her and her two friends, one guy and one girl. She agrees. I say I need two minutes to run in and brush my teeth, but really I also need to get my green backpack too. Rachel is then my classmate Kari Otis, and she follows me into the house. She has a plate of peanut butter stuff. We go into the bathroom to brush our teeth. She used to live in this house. As she enters the bathroom she says, \"Where's my bathtub?\" It's hard to brush one's teeth with one's mouth full. My mom has put my clean laundry on the porch. I feel guilty because I didn't attend to my own laundry. I go outside through the garage, brushing my teeth. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and three others are sitting in my boat. They tell me that the neighbors told them to sit there. I say to them that the neighbors are \"retards\", but I pronounce that word with a short \"e\" sound, so that I sound like a retard. They leave. They're going to ride to school in the trunk of a car. I hurry to get ready. I put on my Texaco shirt, Union Bay jeans, and orange socks.

My grade school classmate Eric Stoner makes fun of me, and says I am attracted to our classmate Misty Ryan. Misty offers me graham crackers. I say no. There is a transfer student, a girl with short dark hair that doesn't have to do with work because she knows the material already. The teacher is diagramming the trajectory-type path of a football on the board. The class is using algebra II and trigonometry to figure the distance traveled on the ground. I think this is very boring. I know how to figure it out. I fiddle with my watch, pressing buttons, trying to get it to work correctly and display the time. The transfer student has left the room. I leave: I don't need to be there. I am at home with my dad and his friend Josh Hemming. They joke about sexual things, and say something about whores swinging around above us in the air, and us hitting a \"bush\", which is a joke about somebody running into the pubic hair of one of these swinging women. Josh says something about having our photograph taken with my mom while we are naked. This appalls me. I run up the front driveway at home around the north side of the house to the back driveway. I meet my friend Yvette Ullman near the driveway. She and I are then in the kitchen. I kneel down, and am lower than her head. We kiss and lean back on the floor. She is very wary of our kiss. I want to have a sexual encounter with her! She is wary of going too far with me. I try to take off her pants to give her cunnilingus. She doesn't want this. I ask if her if she'll \"kiss my penis\", and she agrees to give me fellatio. She could die from giving me fellatio because she has TMJ in her jaw. She has braces. I touch her nipples under her shirt. She says out loud that she wonders if she'll regret not letting me give her cunnilingus. My dad is outside in the driveway with some men who have foreign accents. Some of them are wearing ski-type boots. My dad can see Yvette and I through the kitchen window. I try to act inconspicuous, so he can't tell we're getting it on. My brother Wally pulls into the driveway on his bicycle. He and my dad come in the back door. Yvette and I stop our sexual activity and try to look like we haven't been doing that when they enter. My dad knows what we were doing and he says, \"Good work\", jokingly, which indicates to me that he knows what was happening but doesn't care. I feel dumb. I'm in a farm-type area. There is a flash flood. I walk down by a slippery muddy riverbank and grab an extra pair of boots and socks. I bring them home. My sister Ramona is on the phone with my mom, who is mad that Ramona and I skipped school. Ramona hands me the phone through the front window. I take it. It's my dad on the other end. He tells me to give him a call. I want to talk now, but he won't and tells me to call him back in five minutes. He wants to talk about my sex with Yvette, because he saw it, and he didn't want to talk around the others. I walk around back of the house and go in the back door.

It seems I have some sort of bicycle that I made it to the top with, and that I have to get on to go down. I'm very afraid of going from the top of the tower to the bicycle. I'm in a boat on the ocean with two men. I want to leave. I try to force them to leave; to control them. I have a rope and a 2x4 piece of wood that I use to wield my power. The man gets the rope from me: I lose it. I want to smack the man on the head with the 2x4. He cuts me with a razor blade so I won't go in the salt water. He then pops my air suit, on my body, with the blade. It's dark. The ocean water where we are is shallow: a couple feet deep. The water dries up, leaving a floor.

They get closer and Bubba moves away from the people, towards us, as a way of saying that he was just joking about being with them and bringing the big bed. Kevin and I push off in Rusty's canoe. There is three inches of water in the bottom of it. I say there must be a hole in it, and I see it, bubbling, on the keel near the stern. I tell to Kevin and Bubba to put all the gear in the other canoe, and let me take the leaky canoe by myself. Kevin and I had been fishing. We all see a bald eagle. I point it out. The man, woman, and child see it too. I take two photographs of it while it is flying. I don't know if they'll turn out because the camera is moving.

We have a full tank of gas. I turn off the lights as we leave. We think of a place to go to sleep. It's raining. We don't want to pitch a tent in the rain. I think of going to Jefferson School or the Hill Park shelter where there would be something to block the rain. We stop on the road, pulling over, to take a photograph of a fabulous sunset: it's blue and orange and yellow or pink, in concentric circles on the horizon. A vehicle pulls up, and my high school math teacher Ray Banks gets out. He walks towards us and goes into the outhouse that is next to us on the side of the road. I say hi to him as he passes. I aim my camera at the sunset. Through the shutter I see a list or chart of all the really big (20 pounds or more) northern pike that my grandpa Redding has caught. I then see different parts of grandpa, and I take a photograph of him lying on a table having surgery, in which a metal tool is being removed from his stomach. This may be a drill bit. Ray loosened the tie down rope holding the two canoes on our vehicle as he walked by. We'll have to retie it. I don't mind: we'll just have to redo it, but Ray seems bad about it. After I take the photograph my film rewinds. I open the back and the roll of film has a piece of the starter strip sticking out, like it's a new roll, even though it's used up. I think this must be because after it was rewound I turned the camera \"on\" again before removing the old film, so it advanced again. Ray Banks is then grandpa Redding, and he walks to his old blue car, which he says is a '66, and still running. I tell him my truck only has 50,000 miles. HE comes over and looks at the odometer, which reads 57,xxx. My dad is there. We think of leaving the car and riding bicycles. I think of my brother Wally's road bicycle in the basement at home.

I walk out the front or hour house. I'm leery of things because of the murder. A car pulls up along the curb. I'm leaving, but am suspicious of it so I go over to see what the man wants.

Ramona, my mom, and grandpa Redding all see me chasing him and yelling for help to stop him. I chase him over past our neighbor's house. I jump on their porch and run across it, chasing him. He is dangerous: I see him as loony, unstable, and threatening. We all chase him. I catch him with help from others. Ramona and I corner him by a tree, and a clothesline is there. I get tangled up in the clothesline as I try to grab him, especially the little finger on my right hand. I catch him. He talks about catching a big northern pike. I rip him apart: he is a clothespin.

The helmet is stuck to my head and there is something attached to the top of it: a rope and I think a pulley system so that when I pull the rope down I lift myself up off the ground, stuck to my helmet, which is seemingly cemented to my head. I seem to be on Carter School playground in Oak Valley. I take a photograph or two young black girls. The battery in my camera runs out: it is dead. At first I had straps around my arms to hang myself, then it was just the helmet."

I feel dumb for offering to let them go first, since they said they were first. I get two bagels: one with blueberry and one with apricot jam. After they're prepared, a woman working there submerges the bagels in water to cut them. I get some English muffins to carry the bagels on top of."

I'm back in the woods 50 feet from the driveway digging a hole with a shovel. I move leaves, dirt, and lots of worms. I have branch clippers too. A person is coming up the driveway. I see only their legs under the tree branches at first, and then he or she comes into view. It's a young man with a short red beard. At first I think it's my old roommate Sean Williams. I say hi, friendly, and then see it's my former boss Mike Hollow. He tells me to move my things and pick up the clippers and leave. I show him that the cardboard box I was digging from isn't on some plants, which is why he told me to move it. I ask him why he doesn't respect people. He replies with a question about my respect for him. I know I did maintain respect for him until he became unworthy of it. I walk down the path to the driveway. Mike follows slowly. I tell him that in his dream the skeleton is a part of him, and if he doesn't know that by now he must be pretty ignorant. He doesn't respond, but acts stern and silent, like he knows best. I can't find the clippers, and ask Mike in a friendly manner, which is quite an abrupt shift from my stern words a moment earlier, if they are back near the trail. He doesn't answer. I think I must have walked by them."

I look through a magazine aimed at the teenage girl crowd. I think there has to be a good picture to add scent to that is not plain. There is a two-page picture of a woman, viewed from the side, an all fours. She is partially naked, and her butt is raised in the air. The picture or advertisement has something to do with butt sex, and that is what it reminds me of."

Just as we are starting to play our classmate Daryl Yeller comes in. Daryl wants to sit at the end of the table. It is as if I am preventing him from doing this, even though I'm not sitting at the end. I'm sitting next to Lyle on a piano bench, which leaves only a couple inches between the bench and the table: not enough room for my legs. Lyle doesn't really want me to sit there: he doesn't like me. I think our classmate John Kulik may be there as well. There is great tension and mistrust among us because of the fear that one will cheat. We're not friends. It's a greedy atmosphere: everyone, including me, for themselves. To begin, I pull out a handful of chips from my pocket. I didn't pay for them. They are extra chips, but no one knows that so I take them as mine, cheating. The first hand is dealt, and all the cards are face up. The game is five-card stud. I get dealt a straight, and I pick up my cards like I would to play a regular hand. They guy before me bets one chip. I'm unsure about how this game is being played. I have six cards. There is a wildcard too, which changes with each player. In my case the wildcard is a five. I have three 6's, which I think is a pretty good five-card stud hand. If I can go out by using five of the six cards in my hand, I win, and get the pot. I lay down my 5's and 6's. I think I'll have five 6's and will blow everyone away. But I have only four 6's when I get them down, which is still an unreal hand, but I didn't use all five cards. I pick them back up, and everyone knows I have a good hand, once again (they saw the straight I was dealt initially). I manage to make a straight out of my hand by going Ace-6-2-3-4-5, where fives are wild. I know this isn't legal, but no one catches it. If I were to use the five as a two, then the six wouldn't match up after the four, and I would need to use six cards. I win. There is a feeling that I have betrayed all the guys. Lyle won't hand me the cards, even though it's my turn to deal. He puts them under the table. I criticize and yell at him for this. My mom offers to deal a round of hands for everyone, but the guys don't like this."

I leave, feeling dumb, and say I'm going to work on a dream, even though I'm not going to: that is just an excuse for me not needing to be with her anymore. I leave the building, where there is a party going on. People don't like me. People are mad at me, and I think they'll chase me. I'm on the street in Wilmerton that runs past Jim's Bait Store. I fly and float. I think I am partially awake, and this experience must be what people describe when they say they were half awake and half asleep. I realize I'm dreaming.

There is no break in the conversation, as if no one is sad that Sarah has died. I know they are sad, but I'm not, so I don't react. I'm eating sweet corn with barbeque sauce on it.

I have driven there with my parents. We have twin babies with us. They are in shoeboxes in the vehicle, which may be a mini-van. My dad wants to check the twin's diapers to see if they urinated before we go into the game. I start to do this, but it is bitter cold: windy and well below zero. There is a sheet of paper on top of the first box. As I start to remove the paper I say to my dad that maybe we should do this inside, out of the cold. He agrees. I carry the twins in. I think one is male and one is female. I go in the athletic doors. The woman selling tickets is my neighbor Wanda Stalk, or my aunt Sheila Redding. I ask her if she has sold a lot of tickets. She hasn't, I think. I tell her we sold a lot of tickets last night. By that I mean we sold a lot of cups for beer at our house party. My uncle Rusty Redding is there smoking a cigarette. I give my dad the babies, which are now each in a tennis shoe. They are small. I can't see them when I look into the shoe, but can only see the clothes surrounding them. I pay the woman with a $5 bill. She gives me $2 in change. I hear the buzzer: the game has started. I'm wearing either snow boots or roller blades. I run into the gymnasium, going down the hall past the maintenance area. The hallway opens up into the gymnasium after a quick left turn. As I enter one team shoots a three-pointer from what would be out-of-bounds, on the other side of the backboard. It goes in and is counted. There is a large space of about 30 feet between the bleachers and the court. I sit by myself on the second row of the \"student\" section. I see my cousins Rich, Melvin, and Melissa Redding. Armstrong does well. My old neighbor Tim Robbins and another kid yell at me to come sit with them up near the top of the bleachers. I do this, though I'd rather sit by myself. Next to us are two guys doing the Rocker High School basketball radio show. Armstrong does well, and we cheer. Several parents who seem to be from Rival High School look up at us with disdain. They frown on us and look down upon us, maybe because we vocally support the team. Two of them are my old teammate's father, Todd Kecker, and a person from Rival High School, Alex Zadra. I go down and sit right next to them: in the middle of them. I ask them why they're being so belligerent. I sit and talk with them, calmly. They don't want me there. The two people are not Todd and Alex, but two men I don't know. The game we're watching is a junior varsity game between Rapidville and Holy High School, but it seems one game is Armstrong versus Rival. These players are not varsity caliber. I'm confused as to who is who, and which team is which, because I don't recognize anyone. I don't know who to cheer for. My high school friend Sam Kingsley and his old girlfriend Janelle West are there. Sam is a sitting a few rows down from me. He says hi. I feel dumb, as if I had been ignoring him, which I hadn't been: I just didn't know he was there. Had I known, I would have liked to ignore him. I say hi and we talk. He is in school in Metropolis, but not at the community college because they didn't give him enough financial aid. He attends a different school named Boris. He says it's going okay. I tell him to give me his phone number. I express happiness when he tells me his classes are going well, and this surprises him, because he thinks I wouldn't care."

The man takes a taxi. My advisor Mary Monroe is there. She is the director or boss. My friend Nat Miller is on the side of the road, waiting in a yellow cab. Several people are in the cab with him. He is getting off work, or getting easy work, since he gets to drive the cab. I may be his co-worker. I tell the man it's going to take at least 1.5 hours to get to the airport, which may not be enough time for him since he indicates he needs to be there in 10 minutes. I'm on a school bus with Mary, my friend Norman Noman, and others. A large man asks a question about \"When would be the best time to...?\" I cut him off and say, \"Now\". He was either asking the best time to eat at Dairy Queen or the best time to go to the bathroom. In either case, the answer is now. We all get out of the bus. It costs $3.33 for three Blizzards at Dairy Queen, and one gets a free Blizzard as well, so Norman and I decide to do this and each eat two Blizzards. He gets Heath flavor as his first one and tells the worker to put a lot of Heath in it. I'm getting Heath flavor for one of my two Blizzards as well."

She is then on her back with her legs up and we have sex. When I feel that I'm going to ejaculate I pull my penis out and put it up near her mouth. She gives me fellatio briefly, and I ejaculate into her mouth. She clears her throat loudly and spits the semen out. She isn't tactful and is clearly there just for the sex. When I ejaculated the second time I felt a strong need to urinate, and I may have urinated a small amount immediately following the ejaculation. After I ejaculate I put my penis, which is still erect, back in her vagina and continue thrusting."

I'm in a place that seems to be near my friends the Puffy's house in Oak Valley. They are serving spaghetti or pizza there. My classmate from Brimson Leslie Shell, my former boss Mike Hollow, and my coworker Carol Flanders are there. Carol tries to get me to stay. I get mad and belligerent and punch people. I throw Carol aside and leave. I either didn't get any food or did get food and didn't want it. I'm outside the building, and it is snowing: a blizzard. I think Mike may follow me and bring me back, so I run away. I have my long striped hat with me and I think my green coat. Two older men are jogging out in the snow. They may be wearing shorts or tee shirts: they are under-dressed. I worry about Mike recognizing me. There are six to eight inches of fresh snow, and it's accumulating fast. I walk towards the lumber store. The snow is drifting. A vehicle approaches going fast in the deep snow. I get out of the way. I don't know if the driver sees me. If the driver didn't and then suddenly did, they might hit the brakes and skid, hitting me. Another vehicle approaches from the south from the other side of the railroad tracks. I walk in snow four or five feet deep, engulfed in snow. I hope the vehicle goes by and doesn't recognize me. I think of walking down by the railroad tracks but I don't want to go. I get by the intersection of Home Avenue and Main Street. There is much less snow there, but it is still snowing hard. As I walk, I remember I had a dream, and I interpret it as I walk. It has manifest symbols of death and garbage. In interpret it to be about me changing. I make some sense out of it: make some good connections. I walk home though the alley. The snow is gone, and the ground is saturated, sloppy wet. I walk in the back door at home. Mom and my sister Ramona are baking cookies. My brother Wally is staying at the Holiday Inn for one night and then leaving town. Ramona reprimands me a bit sarcastically. She tells me that I look like a little boy. I say to her that, \"I can do anything I want\". My mom is not in the kitchen. I haven't seen her yet. I'm nervous about seeing her because I'm not sure how she'll react to seeing me.

I say something like, \"It's the birthday girl.\" I'm flirting with her. She greets me unenthusiastically. This couple is dressed up in Halloween costumes that are supposed to be scary. I walk inside the dorm and turn left to the stairs. There is an infant, a toddler, a baby, and other small children to age four or five. They may be watching television. I scare them inadvertently as I walk by with my barrel. I walk up many old stairs, like I'm in Wonkers Hall, dragging my barrel. I get to the second or third floor and there is a lot of recycling in the stairwell area. There is a garbage can full of glass and a cardboard box of glass. I'm going to try to fit it all in my barrel. There is a small cat there. It is dark in color, thin, and furry. It is very soft and tender. It is roaming around, jumping up at times like it is trying to get out of something. I'm scared of being bitten or scratched by the cat. I want to befriend it because it is cute. I pick it up and put it down after a short time, repeatedly. Two custodial women walk by. They ask something or I say something, and we start talking about my roommate Stephen Ramos.

I open the bottle and it starts to foam over, so I suck the foam up. I can't suck all the foam, and some overflows onto a white plastic bag. Two younger men are hiding beers in their pockets. I scold them: there is not enough to go around. They seem immature and overly ambitious to drink. I sit on the floor in front of the chairs. My friends from Brimson Emerald Reinhold, Holly Lapson, and Terry Foss walk by. I say hi to them, with my usual degree of discomfort in their presence. The meeting starts. The president of the Honor Society is a nutty man! He is a physically small man with long straight brown hair. He tells bad jokes. He talks bout hanging black hair. Three black men who are in the audience mock the president for what he says, as if he knows nothing. The president says something about black hair being a mole's vagina. There is a white woman with blond hair in the back of the room. I know she is there. She is a leader of some sort: someone with power. I try to look mature when she can see me. I don't want to seem immature in front of her. I have lost my beer. It may be somewhere but I can't find it, or I decide which one it is from the others on the table. A couple of people run up to the front of the room with beer. As they hold a box, a tear it open and grab a beer. It is a big can of Heineken. I crack it open and drink a lot, though I don't slam it. There is an Asian man there who wants me to share my beer with him. I let out a loud cheer for the beer, and feel immature for doing so."

I clandestinely dump out a partial handful by my right shoe so that she may not see them and I'll get to keep them. I dump the rest in her tray.

I walk by a man I work with at Brimson named Josh Trodden, who asks me why I wouldn't have sex with this other person. I keep walking and don't reply. I walk through a gate at a place that is like a bus depot. There is confusion about which is the entrance and which is the exit."

I show the photographs to my sister Ramona. There is a brick or stone wall or cliff in the photographs. A man looks on as I show them to Ramona. There is a rumbling noise that gets louder. We're near the bottom of a cliff. I know the noise is a rockslide. I wonder if I should run towards the very base of the cliff so that the rocks will tumble over my head, or if I should run away from the bottom of the cliff, trying to outrun the rocks as they roll off the edge of the cliff. I run away from the cliff out onto a flat area. I look back up at the top of the cliff and see rocks tumble off it and hit the ground below. People and vehicles with people in them are fleeing and get corned between the oncoming rocks and the cliff. The people fall or get pushed off the cliff. Vehicles are smashed into and pushed off the cliff by other vehicles and rocks. They tumble down the cliff and explode. It is a tragedy. I feel sad. The people that are with me at the bottom of the cliff have run away safely. We walk in a group, saddened by the loss of lives. We are in Australia at an airport that is near the cliff. There is snow on the ground and we trudge through it, consoling each other. A plane with words written on it arrives, maybe to help. There is a train tunnel that has a bomb in it. Bomb detectors arrive, maybe on a plane. A woman and a small yellow box-like organism are two bomb detectors. They go in the tunnel. A bomb explodes and they \"die\", but aren't really dead. The box and the woman have sex and regenerate themselves. The woman seems mechanical. A very attractive naked man and woman come out of the tunnel. They are bomb detectors that have defused the bomb. I have sex with a woman, and it seems I'm in the tunnel. She squirms and wiggles to the point of an ecstatic orgasm. I'm receiving fellatio, first by a woman, and then by a man. There is white stuff that may be semen, on his mouth and face. It's messy. I position my body so that I have the best angle to penetrate his throat. He tilts his head back."

There is a toilet, and a urinal is to the right of it. I go to the urinal. The urinal is then a small movable plastic toilet. I urinate partially in a shower curtain-type thing, which is cloth and not plastic, and it gets wet. I urinate all over, and urine gets on the floor. When I'm finished I set the small toilet back and put a white plastic chair behind it. I wipe up all the urine on the floor and start to walk out of the bathroom. I man walks in the bathroom. He has long, straight stringy dark hair. I say that he must be Lowell, another roommate, to which he says yes. I go to shake his hand and then realize I should wash my hands first. When I go out of the bathroom there are more people there. Kevin is there with his girlfriend. I joke about having butt sex with him. My friend Tiny Combs is there with his girlfriend. A single woman with blond hair is there, as well as a woman with brown hair who has a baby. The blond woman is not really attractive. I talk to Tiny about the Detroit Lions game. I ask him if he saw the game. He says yes. I compare him to Barry Sanders because in the commentary of the game John Madden said Barry Sanders squatted 580 pounds, and I know Tiny can squat that much! I ask Tiny how class is.

There is a funeral taking place at the church. A white limousine comes. It seems powerful. We sit on the street curb across from the church. The funeral procession leaves. I back up from the curb to the boulevard. I have a feeling of being near my neighbors the Shipp's house in Oak Valley.I'm in a small room in the Uptown Mall. It seems to be kind of where the gold chain stand is. I'm in a hammock. My friend Melanie, and a woman I'm dating named Stephanie Peterson, and Stephen are there. We're talking and doing homework. I remember two dreams that I had. One involved Melanie in a department store setting. It had a sexual feeling. The other dream involved Stephanie. I confuse what woman was in each dream. I talk about he dreams and make more sense of them. I get Melanie and Stephanie mixed up in the dreams. Melanie asks me how I feel about the dreams. I think she is expecting me to say that I'm embarrassed because in the dream my sexual feelings towards her were revealed. She is kind of taunting me very slightly: it's as if she has control in our relationship and wants to get more by encouraging me to admit my attraction to her in real life. I honestly say that I feel pretty good about the dreams. For me, knowing how the dream symbolism fits, how the images in the dream relate to their referents is more important than the actual latent content of the dream. My professor Carly Sweet enters the room. She tells us we have to leave because she is giving a mid term exam to her second group of Educational Psychology students at 10:00pm. The first group was at 7:00pm. I recognize one of the men as we leave: he is a football player for Brimson. We leave and walk in the mall. My friend Nate Nelling is there. I say that we can probably go to my house, which is somewhere near the radio station in the mall. My friend's father and brother, Walt and Ryan Nelling, are walking in the mall, hand in hand. Ryan is younger, about five or six years old. As we walk in the open mall space by Target, my old classmate Tara Stevens is there. She is a manager working at Target.

I walk back and look down, as if I didn't' know there was licorice there, and then say no. I see my junior high crush Erin Jacobs, who may have braces, as I walk by the checkout. I look at her and smile cockily, like I am somehow better than her: superior in my thinking. We walk to an aisle with licorice on the right side. Niles picks up a small bag of black licorice. I want a flavored licorice, like apple. There are big 20-pound bags of licorice, like bags of charcoal. A manager woman comes up to us. She is mad! She asks us about the licorice on the floor, and I deny it, as does Niles. I yell at Tim and ask him about it, and he says he didn't put it here. I'm lying. The woman threatens to question us at the checkout when we leave. I ignore her, asking myself how they'd know it was I. The licorice may be a starburst when I go look at it."

She leans back on me and we start to have a sexual encounter. I rub my hand on her crotch. I can tell she isn't used to this aggression. We take our clothes off. She gives me fellatio and we have sex. There is an open door, and we are in a room. I feel like I'm imagining being with her: like it's not real. I have my erection stuck behind my left leg, and I imagine Jackie sitting on top of me and us having sex. It is good sex. She has never had sex before, and is strong, sturdy, and aggressive. She likes the hard physical contact and penetration. The door closes and I notice a person in blue leaving the doorway. This startles me. My state of mind changes: this seems dream-like, and waking-like. I roll or crawl over to the door and holler/moan. It was my housemate Norman Noman at the door.

There is a small dental floss-like container of aspirin that we could use. It is on a shelf with other items. Nat grabs a big bottle of aspirin. I tell him not to open it because I've got a big bottle back in my room that's already opened. But he has already opened it and broke the seal. I go back to my room to get the aspirin. I want to flirt with Hilary, and possibly have a sexual encounter: I'm horny. It looks as if she could be under my blankets, but I pull them away to see that she is not.

The woman starts to come down the stairs. We hear her and hide. I go into the next room. There are two mirrors positioned so that I can see the bottom of the stairs from behind the wall. I think, then, that if I can see her using the mirrors she'll be able to see me. I move, and as I do the woman walks across a different room, adjacent to the one I'm in.

She is fairly short, about 5'6\", and looks a bit like my high school classmate Rachel Hardy, but is much cuter. It seems that I know her somewhat. I pick her up and lay her down on top of the table, opening her robe. She has very nice breasts. We talk very briefly. I understand that she is 22 years old, and has a 12 year-old daughter. It seems that she had a sexual encounter with a man, who I imagine to be a large, tall red neck: a jerk who mistreats women, and has mistreated her. She is very beautiful, with clear, clean, soft, supple skin. I'm very attracted to her. We start to have a sexual encounter. I start to give her cunnilingus. She mocks me subtly, saying I'm not doing a good job: that I don't hit the clitoris. I lick and rub her clitoris area, but don't find the clitoris. She is experienced with sex, and just wants a good, hard, satisfying fuck. She isn't beautiful or graceful like the woman I put on the table, but still, they are the same woman. I rub her g-spot with one, then two fingers. I think of putting three fingers in, but don't. I do this with considerable pressure. She starts to orgasm. She moves my fingers to where her clitoris is, and I can feel it with my tongue: a little ball of rough, raised, firm flesh. I keep licking her clitoris and rubbing her vagina. I awaken and open my eyes for a fraction of a second, and then close them and remain in a dream.[I'm not sure if this happens in the dream or in real life.]I know I'm on a single mattress on the floor of my room dreaming of having sex.

Melanie is short and has a big butt. Her dark blue jeans are pulled up high. I'm standing on the edge of a gravel-like sand pit filled partially with water. My friend Tim Zelling is in the water. There is a snake by him in the water. I encourage him to move. Then there are several snakes right around him. I don't know if they are poisonous. I know he could get bitten if he moves suddenly, but I tell him to get the fuck out of there! He does get out, and doesn't get bitten. I feel a sting, like a bug bite. I look down and see snakes coming up the side of the bit: I've been bitten! The bite doesn't hurt much but I'm really afraid of what will happen now that I'm bitten. I go sit down and start squeezing out the venom. The bite is on the arch of my right foot: a really tender area. A woman is there, and show throws rocks at the snakes, and maybe at me."

Hercules gets off his horse and picks up a small blue metal bow with a short white arrow. He is very casual about this, and does it slowly. This seems like it is in an area very similar to the pit-room at home. The arrow for the bow has a drawstring wrapped tightly around the notched end. He draws back the arrow with everyone standing around, and fires it into the throat of one of the guards, who also has a bow. As he does this, I feel his motions, as if I am he, shooting the arrow. The arrow was drawn slowly, with all the evil men around. The men didn't do anything about it. I run out of the front door of my home. It's as if I have done the shooting and the men will be chasing me. I'm gasping for air because I have just been shot in the throat. My mom is out near the front sidewalk doing some work, like pulling weeds. I know the leader and men will follow me. I run. I think of hiding underneath the foundation of the house Mike Bautsch is putting up on the corner of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. It's dark under the house, which is lofted off the ground by huge wooden pillars. I run on. The leader of the group seemed so confident he was ignorant."

I'm fooling around in the car, and I look over and see my friend from high school Mya Rousing in the car next to me. We signal each other to pull over. We seem to be on the road in Wilmerton near the livestock auction station and the small fire station. The light turns green and we drive. I bump or shift the Nova into second gear. The engine squeals and grinds. I shift back into drive, and the engine still squeals a bit. We pull off the road and onto a frontage road; Mya drives first. I think that she's beaten me by turning first, and no one beats me! She pulls into a parking space in front of a building. I pull in very close to her vehicle, so I can hardly open the door. I then move the car so there is more space between our vehicles. She is driving a mini van. We get out and go around back of the car. We exchange a big hug, and I pick her up off the ground while we hug. She weights a lot. It's not that she is fat by any means; she is just big. We fall on the ground. I'm feeling very sexual. I tell her that she really looks great, and that she is so beautiful. She has some scars on her face: red spots from acne. I hug and kiss her on the ground. We kiss. It's not that I'm attracted to her, per se, but rather that I'm horny, she's there, and she is fairly attractive. She rubs my penis and I put my hand down her pants. Her crotch feels very skinny, like there isn't a lot of flesh in her lower abdomen or thighs. Her vagina is like a big hole, that is about one and a half inches in diameter, with all the flesh in her crotch stretched very tight to her skeleton: she is very skinny. We're going to have sex. I want to go behind the building and have sex in the grass. The building we're next to is her dentist. She has to go to the dentist's office. She suggests we go in and have sex in the bathroom, and then have sex outside later. I say that good because I'll only last two minutes the first time anyways! Mya is naked, and I'm really aroused: I want to have sex! We go inside the office. There are several female receptionists at the desk. Mya isn't there: she may have gone back to her appointment. I introduce myself to the receptionists. They know who I am because they know my mom, Natalie Redding. I'm sitting down when one of the women dials up a radio show and hands the phone to me to make a song request. I take the phone, feeling flustered, and a female radio show host is on the line. I start to say the name of the office I'm calling from, and the women I'm with cue me in on the name of the place. But the host already knows from where I'm calling. She plays a recording of the name of the office that we're at over the phone for me to hear. I ask her to play Saturday Night Fever, and she says maybe I should listen to that by myself! So then I suggest Billie Jean. She says she won't play that either. I tell her that those are the only two songs I would want to hear, and I hang up. I'm sitting around with the women, and they tell me that I'm responsible for looking after these two small blond-haired boys that are running around by us. I don't know what that entails. I know that the boys don't like to be left alone. There are two men there in their late 20's. It seems they are having a barbeque. They are the fathers of the two boys, and are rednecks. They aren't paying much attention to the boys. I try to keep track of the boys while they run around."

They are really excited. I find them annoying and don't want to be around them. I turn left onto the \"on\" ramp for Superhighway 100 going east. The car of people is behind me. I'm driving a trike: a motorcycle with three wheels. I merge onto the highway and am really glad to be moving: I'll be home in a couple of hours. I get stopped in traffic. There is a tunnel ahead of us. I see the solid lanes of cars backed up to the tunnel, where the road ends. People are turning around and going the other way on the highway. I get up to the scene that is causing the delay, and see that there is a crater-like hole in the highway for about _ mile, and then the highway starts up again. There is a golf course on the right side of the freeway. Others and I think we should just drive along the edge of the course to where the highway picks up again. There are some streams and swampy areas, but some people have four-wheel-drive trucks and they can help out. There are three tall buildings behind me on the right side of the freeway. I'm in a room with some men. I'm anxious to get moving. One man is a father. He is older and he doesn't do much. There is a younger man there sitting on the floor directing things. This man has one regular leg and one very short leg, that extends about to the knee of the regular leg. This man says that he is keeping Sean Williams, my old roommate from Fishing Haven, and I, to go slow with us because we have caused trouble and he wants no problems. I'm enraged! I want to go now! We have to go up to the top floor of the middle of the three buildings. I'm currently in the building on the right. I go in and race up to the top via the stairs, while the little man takes the elevator. We're in a room where a drug deal is taking place. I realize now why he wanted me to go slowly: because the drugs are illegal. There are several people there doing the drug deal. The drugs are packaged securely. The drug dealers are minorities: either black or Hispanic. I'm afraid of them. Different drug dealers put colors on me, from different substances. I get red, yellow, and blue on me. I get angry and react, but am scared of retaliating against these people because they are black and because they are drug dealers. I fight with them."

We go by my friend Gino Teavor's house and come to the intersection of Holy Avenue and Main Street. A man in our group is driving a black Suburban. My friend Tom Napper owns the Suburban, and is with the man in it. The man scratches the side of the Suburban while pulling up to the light, and then backing up next to some cement posts. Tom is angry that this happened. I'm worried that the man won't cross Main Street without being hit by a car. There is a lot of cross-traffic. I don't trust him, and I wish I were driving. I'm on a bicycle next to the Suburban. I balance on the bicycle, not moving, but not touching my feet to the ground. My friend Norman Noman and ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter are there. They talk about the name of a cell. We all cross the street. I'm the only person on a bicycle. My bicycle is an old 10-speed. There are two restaurants to choose from: The Greasepit, or ____, which has a name similar to the Copper Lantern, but is a fast food place by the locksmith on Main Street. I ask people where they want to go. My classmate Fred Potter says the Copper Lantern-like place. We all turn right and go to this place. They serve turkey sandwiches. I go up to order. I see an order being served: it is turkey on two pieces of white bread with mayonnaise and some little trimmings. I ask the man serving it if that's all they have. He says it comes cut in half. I see on the price board that the cost of the sandwich is $4.76. I think to myself that I'm hungry, and would want three or four sandwiches. This is too expensive for me. I get on the bicycle and go to the Greasepit. People yell for me as I go. I go through the trailer park, breaking open a gate as I ride. I ride through a forest. The ground is soft with leaves and needles on it. My housemate Stephen Ramos is behind me in the distance, following me. I hear him singing. I wish he wouldn't follow me. I don't want him to try to persuade me to go back. I just want to just be, and in this case to be without him. The tune he sings is a kind of uplifting, mid 1980's, cheesy, see-the-light song. It goes, \"...and through...\". The pitch is high. I think my friend Matt Yams may be working at the Greasepit."

We get closer. One man is standing in front of the other man on the water. The man speaks to us. He has a weapon and tries to make us stop. I won't stop: I start the 25 horsepower motor and go full throttle, steering straight for them. They say they need help. I run them over, and they dart out of the way. I turn and go back again.

We walk to my truck, which is parked on the curved turn-off lane from where Roundabout Way and the Thru Highway intersect, going towards Yardville. We get in and I start the truck. Nicole climbs in the passenger side window. I notice she is fat. I try to shift into first gear and the transmission doesn't seem to grab. I go very slow, as if I'm in third gear going five miles per hour, and the engine sputters and chokes. I pull out onto the highway in front of a lot of fast moving traffic. I'm going much slower than the traffic. I try to speed up but am still going slow. There is a clicking and knocking sound coming from the engine. I go slow, and then stop on the side of the road. Something is wrong. I look to see what it is. There is a branch dragging from the left rear tire. The right rear tire has some hose or metal pipe-like structure attached to it, extending out from the truck. The tire is torn and ripped to shreds: way past the bald stage, exposing what the tire is made of. I see that the tire is flat. All the tires are flat. The front of the truck slants down, at an angle. Nicole has to be at a wedding at 8:30, and it's 7:52 now! I think of my options. I could run back to my dad's house and have him give us a ride to Nicole's house, or we could just walk on to her house. We're pulled off to the side of the road just south of the bridge. I talk and flirt with Nicole. I tell her I would want a date with her tonight. She says she would want a date with me too. In saying that I expose my long withheld feelings of attraction towards her. I'm going to back the truck up so it's way off the shoulder of the road. I put it in reverse but there isn't enough power to back up. The truck rolls forward and I try to ease off the clutch and let reverse kick in, but it doesn't. There are some white trash beer-drinking men on the side of the road. I feel protective of Nicole, from them. I want to back up, so I try to stop and brake, and then back up. I step as hard as I can on the brake pedal but I keep rolling. So I put the truck in first gear and pull out into the ditch-type median, to get back to where I was. I'm driving on the rims. The traffic is going fast both ways."

I see my old professor Harold Gunther. I take up the slack rope lying on the ground so the man can't jump."

I don't have a lunch token, and I wonder how I should pay for my lunch. Pizza pockets are being served. I walk around what seems to be the new dormitory at Brimson. There are businesses there. It is cold and bleak outside. I walk east on High Avenue. I don't' really know where I'm supposed to go. I walk by a small restaurant, then go back when I decide I'll avoid the school lunch hassle by eating at the restaurant. I go into the place, which is a Sandwich Heaven.

He tells me that the band-aid fell off the sign. The band-aid is the sign. I get angry and I protest that I got a ticket despite there being no sign posted. He says it's still illegal if you take longer than you normally would. I'm mad! I get in the car. Melanie supports me, as if she is my girlfriend. There is a long line of cars behind me.

I want to lay rubber but I don't because if I stall the vehicle I'll look like a fool trying to be \"cool\" in front of Melanie. I give the engine fuel and slowly release the clutch."

Someone steals a piece of paper from my back right pocket, amidst the crowd. I feel this and turn around as the person runs away. I chase them. It is my housemate Norman's girlfriend Sunny Pile. She and Norman are looking for a phone number that they think I have. They thought I took a yellow piece of paper with a number on it, but I didn't. I react violently. I severely verbally reprimand them both, saying, \"What the fuck were you doing? What did you think you'd find?\" Norman mumbles, \"I knew we wouldn't find anything.\" I move about the party and pick up my two pieces of yellow paper with phone numbers on them, to ensure that they don't find the number that I have. I do have what they are looking for. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is standing at the party. I see her as I pick up the papers. There is a tiny dead northern pike on the ground. My brother Wally is suddenly there, in town on business. I'm happy to see him and I suggest we go to a bar. Norman has lost his ID, which is fine with me because I don't want to be with him. Wally suggests we go somewhere where Norman can come with. I don't want to do this, but I agree to do so."

The man tells me that my classmate Arlete has the rest of my keys. I'm in a dorm room. He points me in the general direction of her room. I look for her room, but don't know which one it is and can't find it. I knock at a room where the door is partially open and I walk in a bit. There are several women in the room that tell me that Arlete has moved out. The room is larger then: it seems like a quad room in Wonkers hall. It has bunk beds, desks, clothes, and makeup all over. There are five or six women there that are in their first year in college. One woman is in front of me. She pulls up and takes off her red sundress. She is naked underneath it, and has a very attractive body. I quickly say, \"Pardon me!\" and turn away, so as not to look at her. A tall blond women wearing moderately heavy makeup says to me, \"Do you want to fuck her?\" and indicates the naked woman. I say no, and I act surprised. I'm most surprised that the blond woman asked such a forward question. After the initial surprise, I would have had sex with the naked woman. The idea didn't cross my mind until the blond woman suggested it. All of the women in the room are very horny. One of them says my name when talking to me. I ask her how she knows my name, because we've never met. She says, \"I am a woman...(I forget the exact wording, but it involves the word 'cotton', the idea of maxi pads and menstruation, and the idea of getting her sexual and reproductive needs satisfied by being on the lookout for men). This is how she knows who I am: I'm a potential sexual partner. I take this to mean she has an interest in me, because she knows something about me. I ask all the women if one of them could lend me a door key for the dorms. Six or seven women scramble to get me a key! I really enjoy the attention and admiration, but I play it down and try to act \"mature\". I leave, and a shorter woman follows me. She has a big crush on me. I'm near the door and there are stairs behind me. I push the woman away from me, down the stairs, and then I grab her arm at the last minute before she hits the steps and let her down easy. She seems to be hopelessly infatuated with me. I ask her name, and she says, \"Europe\". I say, \"That's a pretty name.\" I walk out on campus. I needed a door key to get back in the dorm. I am walking by a big psychology barbeque. Many bratwursts are being cooked. I wander over to it carrying a box of potato chips. My high school classmates Gino Teavor and Binky Ahmed are at the barbeque. I talk to them about a poker game. My mom is there. I talk to her about where to sit. She tells me there is a table with a small red cooler at hit over in the corner. This is where I should sit because the person with that cooler is with me, in my group. My dead friend Mark Long is there, with a small red cooler as well. He seems very happy and free, and is having a good time. The group of first-year women is there.

We have two canoes. I climb upon a floating diving raft. Kevin capsizes one canoe. He hangs onto it with his feet and goes underwater, then he emerges explosively from the water and thrusts the canoe up out of the water, flipping it over in the air. I hop in the canoe and start paddling towards Picnic Point. There is a group of women camping at the picnic point campsite, and they're playing in the water. I paddle towards the women, leaving Jack and Kevin behind, but I want them to hurry and start after me. I lose my paddle and I ask some of the women to grab it for me, which they do. We start to paddle. One of the women, who has red hair and braces, says to me, \"You don't recognize me do you?\" I realize that she is my friend from high school Holly Ball. She says I should stop over some time. I nod, but say nothing because I don't really want to stop over, and I know I won't. Three motorized scooter-like vehicles being ridden by handicapped men come down a waterfall and out onto Eagle Lake from Evergreen River. Someone says that there are a lot of there around the Big Resort Area now. I'm on some sort of scooter in the water, moving towards Round Island. My scooter loses power first, it has a low battery, and I may paddle. I don't know how it stays afloat: it is big and heavy and seems to be moving slowly. We are in a Big Resort Area museum in a city. We run through the museum laughing and joking. We go to leave. My hat, mittens, and keys are on a small table in the lobby."

Annie is in the bathroom taking a shower. Bubba is in the bathroom with her. I am wary of how Bubba can be overly persistent and assertive at times. I'm in the kitchen. I quickly eat a Bavarian cream-filled Bismarck with chocolate frosting. I go into the bathroom. I startle Annie by opening the door, and she cuts herself shaving her legs.

I gather up the note cards that are on the sink that may be for my Judaism presentation. On the sink are Annie's bra, an unused, unrolled white condom, and the backing to a maxi pad, which Annie didn't use because her period is over. I really want to have a sexual encounter with Annie. I start to get an erection as I am standing near the sink as she gets out of the shower. She puts on a pair of clean white underwear and a long sleeved shirt, which she leaves open and loose. I am very aroused, and I kiss her. She starts to kiss me back, but stops and starts to talk about what other people will think. I'm disheartened because this is totally not in line with my philosophy. She gets out a notebook in which she has written down characteristics of me. She starts reading the characteristics, and says several words that start with the letter 'z', which I have not heard before. She says I am \"overly ____ (I forget)\". I don't know what all the words mean, but I know they have negative connotations. She seems to think I'm too radical, aloof, one-sided, ill sighted, or too dedicated on the wrong track. She doesn't want to have a sexual encounter with me. I walk away to get something, feeling disheartened. I still want to go back later and see if she wants to have a sexual encounter then. I'm crushed by her rejection, but I still have hope. At some point we discuss our friend Tiny Combs and Middleton College. Annie asks me if anyone else from our high school friends applied to Middleton. I say that Stephen did. Later I realize what she was asking, and that I too applied to Middleton, but I don't say anything."

I'm amazed at this, because it is a 25-foot drop, and neither man so much as flinches. They immediately rush into a store with guns to rob it. They may have ski masks on. One of the robbers brings a man out of the store at gunpoint. The robber then goes back into the store. The man from the store has an Oozy machine gun that he holds behind his back. The robber emerges from the sore and goes towards the man. The robber takes the man's gun. The second robber brings two young women out of the store. Each woman is pushing a snowblower. The snowblowers are being stolen. The snowblowers are put into the bed of a small gray truck and the two women and the man are put in the passenger seat: all three are taken captive. One of the robbers gets in the truck and speeds over towards us to pick up the other robber. He skids to a stop very close to us and the second robber gets in the truck. Those I am with and I have guns. I have a huge black M-16 assault rifle. It's a mammoth gun and could really do some damage. The truck has stopped right around the corner of the building ledge we're sitting on. I whirl around and aim my rifle at the driver's seat where the two robbers are sitting, as they drive away. I'm shaky with the gun: I've never worked it before, and it's all I can handle. I don't fire any shots, and the truck pulls away. One of the men I'm with thinks I pointed the gun at his head when I spun around and took aim. I thought the safety of the gun was off, and it was ready to fire, but I see now it was on the whole time. I'm in a truck. I have two arrows stuck in my left forearm. I pull them out. A third arrow has been shot in my arm, and I pull it out too. I bleed a very small bit, and the wound on the surface is small. I'm on a big swing with others. I still have my gun.

I have been there before, with Niles and Tim Zelling, on our road trip. The area we stop at is very scenic: green, hilly, and lush. There is a small pond that has bass and carp in it that I start to feed blue chunks of something, maybe gum.

A man comes in with a small brown rental refrigerator. The refrigerator is full, and I know it is stocked every Friday. I seem to be by myself. In the refrigerator are cans of Horses Hoof beer and Barqs Root Beer. I drink one and put the empty can on a shelf, which seems to be the second shelf from the bottom of a bookcase under the phone at the Whitman house. I think of drinking a lot more, but I want to see if anyone is around. I see a stairs to the basement, and close the door. I go from the door to the living room, to another room where there are stairs leading up. I go up the stairs and notice there are several people sitting on a couch that I didn't know were there. They were in the next room. When I get upstairs I'm with my friend Niles Zelling, who lives in the house. We're sitting on a bed. There are two couples there. We all talk. I let out a long, loud fart. Niles doesn't flinch when I do this. The men there are jock-types. There is a man there who asks us if we have anything to present. I want to tell him that I have several things to present; that I'm working on factors that effect dream recall in people, and anxiety and personality, and two other projects involving dreams. I see the parking lot of Large Company that is across from Bob's Sports Arena. There is a man with a snowplow. The man says he will only plow snow in the summer. Others and I tell him to work in the winter, and that there will be snow soon. He refuses to work in the winter, and will work only in the summer. I see him in his snowplow when he is in the parking lot. The plow is yellow or orange, and the orange plow holder is in the middle of the parking lot. The man is Chuck Walters, the new paleontology professor at Brimson. I ride with Chuck and one or two other people. We may be in my truck. There is a bag of groceries in the bed of the truck. I feel like there are other bags that I've forgotten. We drive south on Home Avenue in Oak Valley, through the railroad area towards the intersection of Home Avenue and 3rd Street. Someone comments on how everyone gets one of those, meaning, my friend Melanie McDyss, when they arrive in a foreign country. Everyone thinks Melanie is cute. We drive up near my home. I'm on a bicycle, with others. I drive under a plum tree, which may be my plum tree, and try to grab a plum. I go past my house, through my yard, and start to go down the alley.

It is 4:00 or 5:00pm on a warm, sunny summer evening. I smell bacon cooking. I go in, and my mom is happy to see me. They are eating BLT's. I have $1,000 to pick up at home."

I end up near the Super America where I began. There is an apartment building attached or next to the back of Super America, but I have walked six blocks to get there, when I could have taken 50 steps and been where I wanted to go. I go into the apartment building where I live. My friend Sam Crimson is in the elevator, and he holds the door for me as I get in. We go up to the first floor. He gets out and goes to see or do something with our friend Jimmy Youngman. There are many buttons in the elevator. Some of the buttons have the same number on them: there are two rows of buttons for the numbers one through five. I'm going to apartment 18. I hold the door open on the first floor. Four or five young women enter the elevator. Sam enters too. We go up to the third floor where apartment 18 is. I get out, and two of the women follow me. One of them seems to have a crush on me. I try to fend her off by showing her I'm not really interested in her. I tell her I'm probably going out to a bar tonight, and so I can't spend time with her. I start to unlock the door, and two people in the apartment start shouting and moving around: they were having sex. I go and sit by a counter top-like place and talk to the two women while I wait for the two people inside the apartment to get decent. I meet the second woman, who is Asian. The landlord comes out of the apartment. He is old and has white hair. He's wearing a white button-down shirt with a green cardigan sweater over it. My friend Melanie McDyss comes out of the apartment with a shorter Asian man, who is her boyfriend. She is wearing boxer shorts and a t-shirt. She and her boyfriend were having sex. She is aloof, and wanders in and out of the doorway, not really sure of what she's doing. The landlord takes a cat and puts it on the couch, which is in the large, wide hallway that all the apartment doors branch out from. He puts the cat on a bunch of toilet paper that stretches to the door of apartment 18. He wants the cat to urinate on the toilet paper on the couch. He thinks the toilet paper will soak up the urine. He is on the phone at the same time he does this, and he says that this urination is a positive thing, whereas defecation would be negative. The landlord is old and senile. He pushes or shoves one of the men around. The man pushes his back, but he is too senile to notice this. I'm inside the apartment. There is a Christmas tree and an orange road construction sawhorse there. There is a note that says the landlord wants to meet with us at two or two-thirty this afternoon. The other three men that live in the apartment have written on the note messages to the rest of us about what they're doing and how the landlord's meeting will fit into their schedule. I haven't written anything, and didn't know about the meeting: I just got home. I go into my room, which has a large bed. The bathroom door adjacent to my room is closed. The door to the other bathroom out in the main room is also closed. I think Melanie and her boyfriend are taking a shower. There is a clock on the wall with a beer logo on it."

One of the robbers is holding a gun inches from the victim's head, pointing it at his head. The other robber stands about 15 feet in back of the car pointing his gun at the victim, who is the driver. I'm walking with several guys, including my classmate Doug Thompson. I'm not sure how to react when I see the robbery. I move cautiously. The man being robbed tells us to keep walking, past the car. I do. The man drives away. The robbers fire their guns when the man is at a distance, and don't hit him. The others that were with me are still back near the robbers, while I slowly and anxiously keep walking. The robbers rob the other men I was with. I start to run and get away. I'm running down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going from where it intersects Bauer Avenue to where the white house is on the corner of it intersection with Holy Avenue. I see a black woman outside the house and I yell to her from a distance to call 911. When I get to the house I enter through the front door. I go through the dimly lit living room where there is a huge television with many dull colors showing on it. I enter the kitchen where the lights are brighter, and see the woman talking on the phone to the 911 operator. I tell the woman what I know about the two robbers: one is white, about 5'11\", with shaggy brown hair that sticks out from under his winter-type cap, and he had a gun, which was like a six-shooter, that seemed silver, gray, or blue. The other four men I was with, including Doug, have escaped the robbers, and they arrive at the house. The others are younger than Doug. I ask one of them, who is a young black boy, about the second robber. The boy says the second robber was white. I talk on a cellular phone. The 911 operator asks me to hang up, because she can't talk to the woman and I at the same time: there is an electrical or communication problem. I hang up. There is a loud wail in the basement. I go downstairs to see what it is. My sister Heather is there. She has been sexually touched or hurt. Her uterus is sterile, and it is destroyed. She is kneeling on the floor sobbing. There is blood on the floor, walks, and pipes to the sink: essentially everywhere. She kneels and wails while she scoops up bits of bloody intestine-like tissue. These are bits of her uterus. She scrapes them into a pile on the blood-covered floor."

We each pick up an egg. My egg hatches, and a balloon dinosaur emerges. The other egg hatches, but neither last long. I'm near the overpass of Main Street over the railroad tracks. There is a fight on a ledge between animals and others. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and others are tempted, and are fighting to keep from going to the other side. They realize what they're fighting for while the fighting is occurring. This is an episode of the television sitcom Seinfeld. I'm in a ditch that seems to be down by the tracks. There is a lot of food and drink in the ditch, including appetizers and champagne. The champagne bottles are used to kill something, which may be swan-like birds. The corks of the bottles shoot towards the animals to kill them. Others and I try to run down birds. We chase them over by Main Street. A car hits one bird and I grab it. We start to walk back, and are near the white house on the south side of the railroad tracks on the west side of Delivery Avenue. I sense a Tyrannosaurus Rex ahead of us in the distance behind a tree. We all start to run, going north. We get near Carter School. I'm looking for a place to hide that is strong enough to protect me from the dinosaur. I think of hiding underneath the recess stairs, but the others don't think this is a good idea, so we all walk down the alley, going north. There is a small house on the north side of the school with a fence around it. I climb on the fence, to look for shelter. We end up going into an area that is all tiles, like a huge bathroom. The Tyrannosaurus Rex comes; it is following us. We hide and evade it. One man suggests that gingerbread man Olympics be held. The dinosaur follows us closely, and is a man. It is hungry. The man is huge. Someone hits him on the head with a plate. Something happens with food: the dinosaur may sense food. We are all hiding. I run and hide, trying to escape."

I'm familiar with the team of white players, but I'm not a player. We all walk into a gym, which is where the white team usually practices. It's a really nice hardwood basketball court with new hoops, and a nice gym. There is a gathering with parents: a program. Several of the white players put different sheets together to assemble the program. I hand a few of these sheets out, though I'm uncomfortable with this because I'm not a team player anymore. I shake hands with several of the black players and say their names, which I don't understand because I've never heard names like that before."

A fence encloses the army base. They prepare the cannon. One of the soldiers places a big blue and white plastic cooler in the corner of the fenced-in area. It seems to have some power, like a battery, but it's name starts with 'H': H____. The cannon is set on automatic. It is black, about three feet long, with a three-inch wide barrel that shoots cannon balls the size of a softball. It's a mini cannon. I sit on the barrel of the cannon, straddling it. It turns and points at my friend Kevin Simpson, who is in the corner of the fenced-in area. The cannon will fire twice. The first time it will blow Kevin's head off, and then his head will be re-sewn on. Then the cannon will fire again. I sit on the cannon as it rolls up to Kevin and the barrel presses up against his upper neck and lower chin area. I have my hand on his neck below the barrel. I know this is going to be gruesome: his head is going to be blown to pieces. I don't want to see it. I turn my head to the right and squint my eyes. I imagine the cannon firing and blowing off the fingers on my left hand. I see my hand after the shot will be fired. I see a paper printout with lines on it. The lines get shorter on the printout to reflect the missing parts of my fingers."

        "dream_content": "The User TeacherI'm with others in a group. There is a man about 55-60 years old with grayish white hair and a beard with us. He has a blue Geo Metro that he lives in. He is an outdoors type of person. He takes a paddle and a lump of cotton, and starts pulling and stretching the cotton until there is a washcloth on the paddle. Two regular nails and one two-pronged nail for electrical wiring attach the washcloth to the paddle. This is what the old man has to teach us. We are going to work so we learn how to do this. He wants us to haul 20-30 garbage cans full of water up a sandy hill. The man has a young man as an apprentice. The apprentice shows us how to lift a plastic canoe using a paddle for leverage, like a yoke. He wants or instructs us to use the paddles as levers to haul barrels up the hill. He wants us to fill the barrels with dirt and sand. I grab a 20-gallon garbage can and start walking down a sandy hill. I use a hose to spray some of the sand off my garbage can. As I walk down the hill I want to tell the two guys who are at the top of the hill to fuck off, and to leave their can there. It is going to be so heavy and painful to carry these huge cans of water and sand using a paddle on our neck as a lever! Ouch! Then I realize the old man is a fake. His trick with the cotton and the washcloth was a hoax: there was a washcloth nailed to the paddle in the first place, and all he had to do was rub away some loose cotton that was covering the washcloth up. I explain this to my sister Ramona and her friend Barb Mohs while we're standing on metal bed frames, stood on end, at the bottom of the hill. I won't haul the garbage cans. The man was going to use us to haul his water up the hill."

He runs through a yard, over a tall wooden fence, through the back yard, over bushes, and through more yards. Television news crews are covering the story. There is as much speculation that he is innocent as guilty. There are interviews with the running man's friends. One of his friends, a tall man with medium length dark brown hair, questions the man's innocence. The interviewer is a scrubbed clean upper middle class frat-boy-esque man. There is a remake of the scene. The fugitive may have hurt his back flipping over the fence. He may have a broken leg; police don't know. The fugitive could have gone between sparse hedges rather than jumping over them. I see the path he ran. I may be him. He outruns the others. Police may have calculated the man's running speed, in centimeters per second, from the remake of the scene. From this they can project how far he could be. The man is a fugitive! He runs through yards and streets. People chase him, and fall behind as he outruns them. He runs on a street. I see through his eyes. I may be he. There is a wooded area to my left. People come out of the area and point in the opposite direction, indicating the police have infiltrated the wooded area already looking for him, and that he would find no safety in the woods. Some people shake scolding fingers at the man. He (I) questions whether to keep running. It seems futile: the police are everywhere. I wonder if I should hide in a tree in the woods. The police dogs will small me and go nuts, but it may work."

It's hard to discharge the shells intact without firing them. I walk with Stephen and others in a cornfield-like area. I was going to use the shotgun with the magnifying scope, but Stephen doesn't want me to. I end up with the black shotgun. We hear something run through the corn near us. I quickly sidestep into the rows to see if the deer is still there. It's not. We're on a road. A deer runs in front of us into the corn on the left. I don't see it: I was looking backwards. It's a big buck. I get really excited, and have buck fever. I see it run on the left side of the road, and try to get my sights on it. I see it on a hill, with its rear facing me. I get a bead on it and pull the trigger, but my gun doesn't fire. I think later that I didn't have a shell in the chamber. Stephen prods me about not shooting the deer. I defend myself, saying even if he would have seen it cross in front of us he wouldn't have had enough time to get off a good shot. I'm back near a shelter, which is my deer stand.

She has just entered. I go over to her to say hi. I'm happy to see her. She leaves very quickly, out the glass doors, and doesn't speak to or acknowledge me. My housemate Stephen is there. He starts laughing at me, talking about her ignoring me, and repeating this. I'm not facing him, but I turn around after he makes four or five of the same comments. I punch him on his left cheek with my right hand. He is surprised, and in shock, and keeps saying something like, \"Oh my god, I can't believe you just did that.\" He is arrogant and righteous in his talk. I am sick of his righteous holier-than-thou attitude. (He may punch me back; I'm not sure.)I leave. I go into a bathroom. I feel guilty for punching him. I wash my face and blot it dry with a towel. I have a puffy lower lip, like I have been struck. I'm the manager of the pizza-like place in this mall. Stephen and my friend Kristy Puffy may also be managers. I open a door from the bathroom that goes into a natatorium with a huge swimming pool. I don't' want to go in there, so I go into another door. I'm in a hallway. There are other hallways and offices around. I follow the hallway and go past an office where a man is doing business on the phone. I'm then in the back stock room of Ace Hardware. I descend a blue metal staircase to get to the main floor. Other employees are around. No one is paying attention to me. I may be an employee. I look for, and find, a pen and piece of paper. I do this to steal goods, possibly a futon. People come back with their merchandise written on paper, and pick it up here. I can steal in this way. I start to walk away and faintly hear my name, \"Kenneth\". Someone is calling me. I walk on without turning around to see how it was, or if they were talking to me. I hear my name again, louder, \"Kenneth\", and I turn around. It is the manager talking. He has blond hair and a blue Ace Hardware vest on. He asks me what the paper and pen are for. He seems to know I was planning on stealing. I lie, saying I just needed a piece of paper. I don't have a good excuse and am anxious. A male employee comes over and interrupts us, asking the manager about a bolt, which he needs. I say I have a bolt, and pull one out of my right jeans pocket. It is about 1 and _ inch long, black, and is kind of like a screw. This will work for the employee. He takes it and leaves. I'm lucky the topic was changed. The manager doesn't suspect me of stealing any more. It is as if the interaction with the employee made me reliable, as if the employee vouched for my honesty. I walk away into the main part of the store and go past the cash registers near the exit. The store is like Country Store in Oak Valley. I turn left and walk behind the registers, past them all. People are lined up: it is busy. Kristy is a manager, and is helping the cashiers, one by one, and is on the second to last cashier, so I'll get to talk to her in a bit about the incident punching Stephen. I go outside into the parking lot. There is a semi truck or bus that carries eggs, which drives away. There is a trapezoidal-like-structure, which I think I can move. This is like the army. It is winter, with ice and snow. I go in the store. Kristy is almost done. I know I'm wrong for punching Stephen. Stephen and our friend Sam Kingsley walk in, after spending time together. Stephen starts talking to me sarcastically, mocking me nonchalantly, making fun of me, and looking down upon me. He says, \"Sorry my arm hit your head.\" He's really making fun of me, saying, \"Sorry my head hit your fist.\" I don't want to apologize. I did express my anger improperly. I want to explain why he was wrong, more than I want to admit I was wrong, because he doesn't understand that he was wrong."

Two South American-looking men dressed in shorts, shirts, hats, and boots get out of the car and walk into jungle empty-handed. I'm surprised at this, but I think they'll survive because others, including myself, have and do survive. The car is crowded, still. Tarzan tells a man, who may be the bad leader, that he should go into the car and Tarzan will meet him at the edge of the jungle at night. He says there will be enough light for them to make it. Tarzan then goes to the top of a tall tree, at the very top of which there is a bald trunk, broken off, with no branches. He stands on the top of the trunk, with his arms spread wide, and lets out his characteristic Tarzan yell. He then swings down, leaping and catching branches in a strong, sure-gripped manner. On his way down some men are in the tree. The men try to club and beat Tarzan. Tarzan evades the blows and beats the men, injuring them. Tarzan, the strong man, and the leader/manager are in a prison. Tarzan's hands are cuffed behind his back, and his is chained up facing the strong man. Tarzan and the strong man fight. The man head butts Tarzan, and Tarzan's face becomes red from blood. Tarzan rams the other man into a wall repeatedly. The man is facing a wall. Tarzan smashes his head into the wall repeatedly until the man is senseless. The fighting happens in a hallway outside a door with an automatic timed lock. The leader/manager and the strong man are put in the room behind the door, which is the prison. The door closes and makes the initial latch. Tarzan is still connected to the bad man by chains. When the door closes, the chains break. The manager tries to open the door when it starts to close fully. Two of his fingers get caught and are severed in the closing door. This door seems indestructible, and unstoppable. The bad strong man and the manager are in prison, and Tarzan is not."

There are some people already in line for the flight. I try to find the right place to stand, because the line seems to branch off into two lines. I choose one of the lines and stand in the metal corral-like line. I'm then the first person in line. A woman calls out for anyone who is flying to Reinhorse, which I know is in Germany, to come to the front of the line. Several men walk by me and descend a staircase to talk to the woman. I hear the woman ask if any of them are willing to change flights, because the flight they're on is really full. The woman says they don't have to change, because they do all have a seat on the flight, but if they did change they would receive compensation. While they talk, we all start to move, and I realize we're going onto a plane flying to Los Angeles. We take off and immediately make a hard right turn. The plane keeps rolling, and we fly in a spiral, spinning like a top as we fly forward. One of the engines is out, and that is causing the spiral. The stewardess says the passengers need to pound on the inside of the walls to get the engine to start, as if it is just stuck. The emergency exit on the plane is open. The engine doesn't start. We spin and fly. People are yelling. I sit next to several men, including my housemate Stephen Ramos. I yell and laugh. We are in a pretty good mood considering we're probably going to die. I joke about how our plane crashing could make a great Fox television special, like \"World's Worse Plane Crashes\". We don't gain altitude, and must land. There is a train below us entering a train yard. If we could land on top of the fast train, we wouldn't crash, and the train could just slow down. We seem to be going in for a landing at the train yard. Then our plane is on the snow-covered ground on a street, sliding, not very fast. I think that since we're in the nose of the plane if the plane slides into the house at the end of the road we could get hurt. The plane stops on the road. I get out of the plane and talk to Stephen. I tell him this whole episode has been so amazing that I must be dreaming. I say this very nonchalantly. I turn and look back and the plane isn't there: I am dreaming!

Some people carry signs from high school chemistry about a mol of food. There is one drawing of pizza that looks real. People sit near me. They say something about me eating a mol of food, which may be burgers, fries of pizza. I chuckle at this, knowing it's not something I'm interested in trying to do."

It drops fast, and I float off the floor and hover at the ceiling because we descend so fast. I walk to a huge auditorium that is divided into sections, which are classrooms. I go to room 105. There is a class there taking place. I sit at the side. There is a large movie screen with an introductory/informational movie playing. I know when my class meets in 10 or 15 minutes, we'll see the same movie. The male professor is Asian. He is absentminded, and doesn't think in the same time frame that other professors do. He is like Apu from the television show the Simpsons, or my anthropology professor Harold Gunther. He doesn't plan ahead, but deals curtly with problems as they arise."

I wonder what will happen if I don't check out the movie properly and the alarm sounds as I exit. I'll feel awkward trying to explain that someone gave me permission. There seems to be one man in charge of the store. He goes to the door when someone rings the bell. I walk on and start to look at photograph and wedding albums where there are many photographs of naked couples. The couples are covered in blankets or bubbles, their bodies partially obscured. I see my cousin Helen Ralston's wedding album. I look in it and can't decide which woman is Helen. There is a blond and a brunette woman. The brunette woman is much prettier and I hope it is she. I find more photographs that make me realize that Helen is the brunette. She is beautiful."

It seems to be near, on a car, where others and I are. The head of the snake may or may not be poisonous. The tail looks like a head, with eye and mouth-shaped features. A man may get bitten on his nose. I don't think this is serious, or poisonous. There is a man who leaves his house with his teenage daughter and her boyfriend. I may be the man. The boyfriend drives. They are going to kill the snake. The man has a black handgun, loaded and cocked with the safety on. I sit on the left side of the boyfriend and shift gears. He is a beginning driver with a stick shift. It's dark out. We approach an intersection where we have a stop sign. The boyfriend doesn't stop. I look to see if there is cross traffic, and see none, so I don't do anything. We go through the stop sign. I tell him we just ran a stop sign, he's lucky there were no police, and that I looked for traffic."

I scramble to find beer, thinking of my options. My brother Wally says the outpost store may be open. My friend's father Dick Zates arrives with a couple pounds of ground venison. I greet him and take the venison from him. People are playing cards in the living room. I ask if I can play a hand quickly. They say no, but I still have cards. I have two Queens, two Aces, two Jokers, and some other cards. They seem to be playing a progressive poker game, and one has to have a full house to open the betting.

I look at her overtly and make eye contact. I give her a little halfhearted smile, like I always do, and keep walking. I walk past the library. My classmate Nellie Hammer walks next to me and says, \"Hi Kenneth.\" I turn and say hi, feeling choked up, as we walk. She is wearing red tights. She slips on an icy spot, and makes a pretty good recovery before falling down. I chuckle jokingly at this. We talk and walk towards Courtyard Hall. She is much more agreeable than I would have guessed by looking at her. We part paths. I walk towards the student union. There are several bicycles in the bicycle rack, including my housemate Stephen's old red bicycle. There is a man on a skateboard that skates up and jumps onto the front fork of Stephen's bicycle. I think this is odd, and wonder why he's doing it. Stephen skates up on his skateboard, coming from the library. I walk into the student union. A group of women, including my acquaintances Pat, Gail, and Nora, exit as I enter. They say hi to me. Right as I walk in the door people are conducting a survey for which one is pressured to participate in. My friend Jill Banks is there, and says there is a party at our classmate Sean's house. The survey is about homosexuality, society, and service. I'm not interested in it, and walk on. I go to get my mail. I'm mellow, almost bored, and I feel a bit down: depressed. There are no locks on the mailboxes, which open like bulk food bins. I lift up the lid to my box and get my mail. I have three slips for packages. One of the slips says it is a \"Ball and Chain\" package. I have two skateboards with me, which are hard to carry with my other stuff. I look at my mail solemnly. My friend Melanie McDyss comes up to me and gives me a big hug. She seems to notice that I'm feeling down. Her hug is unexpected, but very nice, and I appreciate it. My classmate Rachel Tandor is there. I hear her talk about her homework problems. I start to give Rachel my sleep and dreams lecture, saying how they are more important than other work. Several of Rachel's friends listen, sitting at a table. I say people need to focus not on work, but more on sleep and dreams. Then I joke, \"Look at me: I focus on dreams, and look how smart I am!\" We all laugh. Rachel had interrupted my hug with Melanie, and I want to talk with Melanie. I hope I can get my three packages: it's almost 4:30pm, and the post office will close soon."

There are some people with guns near the garage! I go up to them and ask them what they hell they're doing with rifles. One gun is a deer shotgun, another a rifle with a scope. I tell the people with the guns to leave! They are stubborn. These people are back from the dead. Two of the Peppercorn sisters are there, and say hi to me as I walk around.

The bench faces west, towards a store where a woman is working. The store is small, and the woman neatly dressed, and selling small, expensive items. I seem to be wearing gloves. I get a basketball out of my backpack. I sit on the edge of the bench, bouncing the ball. It gets away from me and rolls towards the small store. I get up and follow it, but not hurriedly. It rolls into the store, and I go pick it up, apologizing briefly to the woman. She is really mad, and gives me a deathly look. She says she's going to call security, and then does so. I go and sit down on the bench. I'm worried about what security will do when they arrive. I see the security guard that I know from high school. He struts over to the store in his characteristic way. After a brief interaction there he walks past me. He trips over my legs, which are outstretched. He sits down next to me on the bench. I think he's going to say something about the basketball rolling into the store, but instead he tells me he caught a two-pound bass! I ask if he caught it through the ice. He says yes! He says he and another man also caught a six-pound walleye and a small bear! He says he also shot a small bear. I cut my index finger on an object that one usually wouldn't get cut on: it seems to be a relatively flat sheet-like structure, like a piece of cardboard. The cut is about _ inch long, and very fine, like a paper cut. I put a band-aid on it, and instead of wrapping it around the tip of my finger, I apply it lengthwise, over the tip of my finger. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. She meets a fat man. I hear her talking to him. She has doubts about our relationship, and I hear her talk negatively to him about me. The band-aid doesn't stick to my finger. I have a small black bear in my hands as I sit on the bench. It's about three inches high. It has a white stripe down its back and large fangs like a saber tooth tiger. People playfully put their finger in its mouth, poking its large teeth. I'm wary of this, even though it seems to be such a cute little playful animal. The bear is getting sleepy in my hand: it is drugged."

I find a joint of marijuana on my bed. One of the guys says they cornered a mouse. I ask if he killed it, thinking to myself: what good is it to just corner a mouse?

There is something called an air curare, which makes one's eyes burn, and produces toxic gas in decaying bodies. There is a war occurring. I see my classmate Megan Cunningham near the Wilmerton Hospital. There is a question of skiing in Vail, and a question on Valex, which is how to use a reference center. There is a question about how Judd Decker would take a ___ ( I forget) pill, and how to take drugs. I'm supposed to list the page number that I find the information on so even if I guess the correct answer it doesn't matter. There is a farmer who won't put grain into his anus through a funnel any more, at a National Guard Armory. There is a question on high altitude urination."

I have on sweat pants and flip flop-like slippers on. I put a key or set of keys inside the bottom cuff of my sweat pants. It's winter. As I enter the building I see my friend from Brimson Beth Mock, who I know is my high school classmate Carol Derth. I go up to her to talk. I feel uncomfortable: we haven't seen each other in a while. Beth has short, dark hair. I realize she has cut and dyed her hair, because Carol had blond hair. She asks if I like it, and I say, \"No\", very bluntly, and walk away. My friends Sarah Reed, Mya Rousing, and many others are there. I go sit down for class. My old teammate Simon Naver is sitting at a table. Others I know are at a nearby table. I sit by myself at a table because I don't want to associate with many of the others. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes and sits with me. Our old teacher Phillip Hacker is teaching Pre-Calculus. We're in the commons-like area, with many tables. I forget my book, so I write a note to myself to get it. I also write a note to my friend Melvin Dahlheimer so that he remembers to get any books he'll need for a class. I'm in the driver's seat of a car with Annie and another woman. I give Annie a letter in an envelope that I've just written, but haven't yet put a stamp on. I give her the letter rather than mailing it to her, because she's there. We're on a class field trip. The car in front of me takes off. I hurry to catch up and almost get lost. We come to a freeway. People in the class are on bicycles. I get on a bicycle and start pedaling. I ride on the freeway, not sure of where those ahead of me have gone. I ride fast, leaving many people behind. I go through a tunnel and am in a house-like structure. I open several doors that have brick walls behind them, so one can't step through the door. It is as if the doors were mounted on the brick wall for decoration. I go downstairs carrying my 10-speed bicycle. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is on foot. We hug and laugh and joke. I go out of the house into a garden-like area. Some people, who may be students, are there, with a teacher, who may be Phillip. There is a moss-covered coffin there. I scrape away the moss from the top of it. I uncover a key hold on the middle of the side of the coffin. I'm happy because I think there is only one keyhole. It seems to me that this is a treasure hunt, and because I have uncovered the only keyhole, I'm the winner. The teacher seems to have the key. A second keyhole is uncovered at the head of the coffin. The top of the coffin slides off when it is pushed: no key is needed to remove it. I wonder if this could be a hoax, or if the coffin was robbed, because nothing in the coffin strikes me as important or valuable."

It has strawberry Quik-like powder on top, which I am not impressed by. To pay, I take out the wad of bills in my wallet and give them all to the girl. She takes a $10 bill from the stack and I take the rest of the bills back. For my change she gives me a $10, $8, $7, and $5 bill. I look at them and wonder if I'm not aware of the new $7 and $8 bills. So I say to the chief, \"Look at this!\" From the look on his face I know the two bills are counterfeit. I tell the girl to take the bills back and give me real change. She gives me genuine bills, which are playing cards in a cardboard box. The counterfeit bills she gets by breaking cards off a strip of cards that are connected. There are fish in the box. I may dump or strain out some of the water in the box. The girl working casts a fishing rod, and the line goes out into the water around us. The police chief and I try to promote this: her fishing, as opposed to her counterfeiting. Her lure is a fly-like Mister Twister type jig."

I board the plane and find my seat. I sit next to the aisle of a section of three seats, on the side of the plane. Then my ticket says my seat is forward, so I move up to the second row, behind the cockpit. There are only two seats on this side, and they're bigger. I'm happy to have a larger seat for the long flight. I can see the pilot, the windows, and out the front of the plane. Someone tells me this isn't my seat, and I must move back a few rows. I then see my seat is in the middle of the middle section of seats: the one place where I was hoping it wouldn't be because I can't move due to lack of leg room."

It's called piano skiing because the keys on a piano correspond to the depressions in the snow from where the person landed. My friend Nate Nelling and grade school classmate John Ryan are there. There are small brown paper bags of apples. I take an apple to eat. I'm in a motorboat driving down a road, with no water. The road seems to the one that goes past the police station and post office in downtown Wilmerton. We go westward, and are past the main turnoff for 3rd Street. Nate tells me a dream. John asks me, \"What does control mean?\" I think this is backwards because usually people ask what a symbol in a dream means, not what symbol corresponds to a topic like control. We're outside a house. Somehow Nate spills a garbage can there, and some of his own garbage. He rips his shorts. I'm annoyed, and start to clean up the garbage. There is an empty cigarette box and a lot of candy wrappers from small colorful gel-fruits. An old woman comes out of the house. She's mad that the garbage is spilled. An old man, her husband, is then there, to my left. Nate and I apologize for the mess, and say we're cleaning it up, but the couple says they want us to leave. I wonder if a fly could get into their house, sneaking in unnoticed, and survive. I think of this as if I am the fly, hiding under the table ."

I flip the light switch, and a second switch next to it, but both light bulbs must be out. I find another switch lower on the wall and flip it, but that bulb doesn't work either. I have a huge erection: about 2 feet long, and rock hard. I grab it with both hands and bend it slightly towards me and suck it hard. I can detect the pulsating action that an erection has: how the ejaculate emerges in spurts. I can't give myself fellatio as well as others have given me fellatio. My erection is a big, hard, rigid object. I suck it roughly and forcefully, and feel my teeth bump into it. I try to deep-throat my erection. I want to ejaculate. The fellatio is pleasurable, but I don't feel close to ejaculating."

I get the feeling that someone or something may be responsible for the light being on. I go downstairs to check this out. I'm a bit afraid, like someone may be hiding there. I turn on all the lights in her room, which seems to be the basement bedroom at the Whitman house. There is a washer and dryer in her room. I walk out into the rest of the basement, which seems like the basement at home in Oak Valley. There is a washer and dryer where the old laundry chute would empty out. I look at that washer and dryer for a bit, and then notice that to my left, standing there, is Ted Matson, my high school classmate. He's standing very still, like he doesn't want me to see him. His head is between two boards in the ceiling. Other people come down the stairs. One of them is a man, and he says to Ted, \"You're gay.\" Two people have a huge bag of red, blue, and silver Hershey Kisses. The blue kisses are icy cool, and some have nuts. Others have smaller kisses in them. Others and I eat some. I say to Ellen, as an explanation for the light, that maybe the noise of the washer in her room overpowered the noise of the other dryer out where the laundry chute used to be. My high school classmate Lori Stanoff may be there.

Someone gives a yell, and the hunters rise up and fire. It seems like an unusual word that one of them yells. Ducks fly everywhere, but remain in the area surprisingly long, flying around. A loon flies directly at me, really low to the ground. I grab its feet and swing it around, smacking its head against the blacktop repeatedly. I think it must have been hit by one of the shots.

The sign is for the first right, and I wonder if I'm going the wrong way; if I've gone past the road. I drive fast down a gravel, windy, hilly road. Kevin is in the car behind me following. It's difficult to keep my car on the road because I go so fast. We arrive at a beach area. There are people painting on a wall. There is a preacher-like person there. This seems to be a religious-musical cult. The atmosphere seems to captivate or suck Kevin into it. People try to make us stay: to detain us. We throw fruit and fight, as they do. My former supervisor Ron Fontana is a leader-type man. People throw large tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and berries. I hit Ron with one, and it knocks him back. He throws a green pepper-like fruit at me. I catch it. There is a large sand hill in this place, about 20 feet high, and a water hole that is like a miniature quarry, next to it. There is a key and a board near the water. It may be just above the water, hanging or hovering. I'm frantically trying to escape. I scurry up the sand hill and dive to get the key. I almost lose the key in the water because I have a poor grip on it. There is a very shaky wooden bridge running from the top of the sand hill to a place. This seems like an escape route. Kevin is there, in a blimp. The blimp is about three feet long, and dark in color. There are two teapots connected to the blimp. This is an escape. I grab onto the teapots and hang from the blimp as it rises. Another younger man wants to go too. I tell him to grab onto my foot.

There are no chairs on my left but the other rows in front of and behind me seem to be normal airplane seats. As the plane begins to move, a person or people in back of the plane begin to say the prayer of travelers that I know from my childhood, substituting the plane for the car in the prayer. Others and I repeat the prayer out loud after a leader recites each line. The plane starts to go fast, and then slows. I wonder if something is wrong; something seems to be wrong. The plane turns around and seems to go up a stairs or a ramp. Three men with joysticks are controlling the plane. I see them as the prayer is being recited: \"...alertness, good judgment, and quick decision...\" I think that these men must be pretty good at controlling the plane. I hope everything goes smoothly. I'm in an airport with a group of people, in Australia. My friend Matt Yams is there. I carry six sheet-like boards of yellow Styrofoam.

He's warning me that others may not like my art. He implies that people don't like overconfidence. I tell him that I'm not here to produce a masterpiece; that I'm just here to have a good time. I grab a cracker from a plate of crackers that is sitting out, and go to follow Stephen. The cute woman is near me, and we look at each other again. I smile, and she flirtingly says, \"What?\" I wave hello to her as I follow Stephen. We get down near his easel. The woman has followed us to talk to me. I'm near the easel. She walks up to introduce herself. I quickly point to my mouth, indicating that I'm chewing a cracker and can't talk, and indicate for her to give me a minute until I'm done chewing. Stephen has a two-legged table, which is the easel. It is a flat table that stands on two diagonally slanted wooden legs. He sets up the table. My mouth is dry as I chew the cracker. I'm nervous about meeting this beautiful woman who is obviously interested in me. It takes me what seems like forever, several minutes, to chew the cracker. She has clear, clean skin and shorter brown hair. She is strong, but doesn't look overbearing. She is firm and very feminine. She introduces herself as Angelica."

Among the men are my acquaintances Walt Thompson and Mike Bautsch. Something may happen with dogs, and the race. I'm in the rafters of a dark garage with a person I know who is my age. We hide, and stay very still. A family looks for us. I have my legs hanging down, and think it will be easy for them to see me. They don't see me. I hold still for a bit, and then make a noise, calling out. They find where I am, with some difficulty. They pull a ladder over at my request, and I step onto it to get down. I then move the ladder so the person I'm with can get down. For me to reveal our location was defeating the purpose of our hiding. I say I was just tired of hiding. There is some kind of challenge with steps, and I have not undergone all the steps. I have one step or a portion of a step left. It is getting late, starting to be night. Something happens with men carrying guns. There is a house or houses that need to be secured. The men with guns pose a threat, and they are not checked. Something happens regarding leadership."

Someone, maybe I, washes dishes. I'm a stocker and a grocery store. I walk with a cart of toilet paper, with Tim, to where the toilet paper is on display. We cut up the boxes of the toilet paper for the display. I cut some of the packages of toilet paper, through the cardboard, with my cutters. There is a special on toilet paper. I'm back at the dock where I parked. A man tells me where my boat is. I find the boat, which is one of two at the end of the dock. It is a nice boat and motor with a steering wheel and throttle in the rear of the boat. There is a city on shore. The bridge makes me think the town is Hillston. I think that would be a ways away, but I don't know where else I'd see the bridge. I idle the motor. There seems to be some metal beams in the water, near the surface.

There are two large fallen tree trunks, and we put twigs and branches around these trunks to get our fire started. We light it. In a short while it has gone out and is smoldering. I think some of the wood may be green. Someone lifts up one of the huge tree trunks and we find four or six cardboard boxes, which look like the Henry Weinhards boxes we have at the Whitman House, crushed underneath it. We try to get the fire started again using books of matches. I try to light it, but I run around the felled tree to light the fire after I have lit the matches. The matchbook flares up and goes out before I can light anything. There is a breeze, which makes things a lot more difficult. It is getting dark. A person tries to light some of the cardboard with a match. A group of us crowd around to block out the wind. I use my hands to cup around the match. It works, and we light a piece of cardboard right in its center, and a hold burns through the cardboard."

I see she is on the ground, fully clothed, in obvious discomfort. Someone makes a comment that makes Esther laugh. The laugh causes her to have the baby. It seems that something comes out of her birth canal though she is fully clothed. She makes painful noises, and writhes. She is then holding a baby that is five or six inches long, and very pale. It seems not fully formed or developed: an embryo. She holds it close to her head, bonding with it. I hold it. It isn't slimy like I thought it would be. It's like a doll, but more real. It shows no signs of life. There is a woman working in the gas station. I talk to her about getting something, like ice scrapers, as if we are entitled to them. I go outside with her and she takes two large plastic ice scraper-like objects from a vehicle, and gives them to me. I know she is stealing. I hurry to our vehicle, hoping the others come quickly. The others do come, but a man also comes claiming we have his ice scrapers. The scrapers are on the front passenger seat. We deny that we have them.

It is similar to the Talent Show at Armstrong High School: there are several skits. There is a skit with Al Bundy eating a big blue fish, that is about five or six feet long. I may be in one skit, but maybe not. I thought I had a role in it with my friend Stephanie Peterson. As the rehearsal goes on I think I may not be doing the skit: there may be another person doing it. I sit on the very edge of the stage with others. At some point I move off the stage, but some to hang on to the carpeted edge of the stage, so I can see and so I'm not blocking anyone's view. The director is a short, fat old woman teacher. She is a bit like my fifth grade teacher Beth Clafton. I'm then sitting by myself on the front of the stage, as the rehearsal is taking place. The director woman asks me condescendingly what I'm doing (on the stage). I tell her I'm sitting there kind of laying on my side so others can see: if I sat in a seat the person behind me wouldn't be able to see. She frowns on me with disdain. I move down to the seats and sit in the front row with my bush hat on. I am angry with the director. The skit that I thought I would be in seems to be a religious sort of enacting Joseph and Mary. There is a skit where one character loses an eyelash at the Prom. The director lashes out at the students, questioning and criticizing their actions; the reason they pluck their eyebrows. People don't respond very much to her criticism. I speak up and talk back to her. I mock her nonchalantly, smarting off to her. Then I stand up, and am enraged! I yell furiously at her, \"Get the fuck out of here!\" I yell that she has an appointment in my office at 4:00, meaning that she is going to have to deal with me. I yell, enraged, that, \"I'm going to beat your ass!\" I'm furious with her, and I say this in front of all the students. I force the woman, half dragging and half pushing her, out the back sacristy door of Carter Church, where it now seems that we are. I force her to start walking west on 1st Street. I see a truck parked on the northwest corner of the intersection. I think in the truck are my classmate Kevin and another short black man from Brimson. I get close to the truck, pushing the woman along, and I see it's my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper driving. I tell him to help me get away. I think people from inside the building will follow, and I'm in a hurry to get away. I want to throw the woman in the bed of the truck and hop in, but Jerry drives away before I can. He stops near the house on the next corner, in the driveway. He is then driving a small black car. He opens the trunk of the car and I toss the woman in. I don't hear much struggle from her: she doesn't put up much of a fight. I get in the back of the car and tell Jerry to drive out near Superhighway 100 to get away. Our classmate Eric Stoner is in the passenger seat. The roads are snowy and icy, and the car slides. I tell Jerry not to get rear-ended because there's a person in the trunk. We drive past Home Avenue going west. I tell Jerry to take a left on Hill Avenue so we don't have to go down the hill at the bottom of 1st Street, because it's slippery. I look back and see that there are no cars behind us from the church, so no one is following. I am relieved."

Annie enters the bathroom and tells me her mother is going to cook dinner, and implies I am invited. I'm a bit happy because I won't have to go to this dinner, using the excuse that the long nap I'm going to take will overlap the dinner hour. Back at the show, Tracy Chapman is playing next. I sit at the kitchen table at my home in Oak Valley with Stephen and our friend Kevin Simpson. They have or are getting submarine sandwiches, which look like Subway Spicy Italian sandwiches on white bread. I cut out holes in the layers of pepperoni and place pickles there. Stephen does not want tomatoes, but he does want lettuce, which I don't put on at first. My classmate Hanna Landers approaches me as I sit and says, \"I might consider paying.\" She seems to be in charge of admission costs and implies that I should pay her here and now. I am guilty of not paying. I get out my wallet. I ask her how much. It is normally $5, and she tells me $8. I ask her plainly and accusingly if she raised the price. She replies flatly that she did. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, and seems to have some sympathy for me. She may toss me a few caps, a portion of a red roll of caps that are used for a cap gun. They fall next to me on the floor. Stephen says something about Tracy Chapman drinking Budweiser. I think: Why would Tracy Chapman drink Budweiser? I imagine she'd boycott it or something, but not drink it! So I bet Stephen $20 that she doesn't drink Budweiser. He and I shake hands. Tracy Chapman then comes over to the table, walking behind me, and sits on my left. As she does this, I ask her if she drinks Budweiser. She says yes, and sets a bottle of Budweiser on the table in front of her as she sits down. Stephen and Kevin laugh. I think Stephen must have seen her drinking this before the bed, so I don't intend to pay him, and I don't think he'll be too concerned about enforcing the bet he cheated somewhat by tricking me. Tracy Chapman, who seems like Tracy Bonham, is then white, and I think she's cute. She and Melanie are both sympathetic that I had to pay, and they both give me a portion of a roll of caps, which is a symbol that I've paid. Hanna knows I didn't pay because I didn't have my hand stamped. Others who haven't paid pay now. I get a beer. Tracy says I should ask her next time and she would get me a beer, and implies everything will go smooth with paying to get in. I get up, acting obnoxiously, and pretend that I'm giving Hanna my Budweiser beer. She grabs it and we get into a tug-of-war. I win, as she pulls the cap of the bottle. To spite her, I slam the beer, gulp by gulp, though it takes me a while to drink the whole beer. I show my contempt for her."

I start to give fellatio. I put his penis deep into my throat. His penis stays fairly limp, and he moans a lot. I move my finger down towards his anus, which is wet, but he doesn't want me to stimulate his anus, and declines this. I ask him to give me anal sex. He is going to, and I tell him to use a condom. My backpack, which has condoms in it, is on the door handle. I tell him to use a lot of lotion. He is about to penetrate me when the door opens. My high school classmate Elise Rooks walks in, as if the room we're in is a bathroom. I grab a towel as she enters, wrap it around me, and walk out of the room to the bathroom. Elise finds Seth naked with an erection, wearing a condom, and she knows what was happening. At that instant everyone seems to know. I go to the shower. A man is there with a baby in his arms. He pushes a door closed on my while I'm outside the bathroom on a small deck-like area. He tries to lock me out of the bathroom. He is mad at me for my homosexual acts. I push the door open and go inside. Downstairs, others are disgusted and angry with me for my homosexual acts. There is an upheaval of the family here, at what seems to be a family reunion. Many people react strongly, and are homophobic. One or two people say my behavior is okay. I tell everyone I called the police and everyone, including family, has ten minutes to leave. I'm out in front of the house. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there in a group. She tells me she found number two, implying this is her number two male partner. She does this to taunt me. She and her group, which includes my high school friend Holly Ball, start to walk away. They taunt me. I pick up bottles that are lying around and throw them into our yard to consolidate the mess. Two houses down, the yard is filled with heaps of empty plastic Pepsi bottles, and others bottles. There are two young black kids in this yard. One is between eight and ten years old, the other between 12 and 13. I tell them if the mess in their yard is from our party than I'll clean it up. They say it is from our party. I'm prepared to take care of it. Their reply is very shaky, and I question them again. They admit the mess is from a party held at their house by their father. I want to run over to the group leaving and tell Annie and those taunting me to eat a big fat dick: to fuck off! Then they walk beside me. I tell Annie I don't want to talk to her anymore. Holly and Annie walk and pester me. My academic advisor Mary Monroe is there. Our house is bluish-gray in color. In and around the house are many skulls and bloody, fleshy body parts and limbs of small dinosaurs scattered about. There are several old men in the house to assess the house. One of the men is a dinosaur specialist. I ask him how the place looks. He says it is littered with skulls. My friends Beth Mock, Brittany Johnson, and others that I don't want to see are there. I pick up glasses on and around the floor."

I need to do some business at the bank, including getting traveler's checks. Nat gives me a $5 bill to get him a container of Globe Lights cigarettes. I hesitate briefly, wondering if he should smoke in the car with my mom and Ramona as we drive, and wondering why he doesn't get them himself. We seem to be driving a red car, like my friend Nate Nelling's family's car. I go in and wait in the bank line for a bit, and then decide to get the cigarettes first because the bank lines are long. The tag under the plastic container of Globe Lights says $3.88. I ask the man behind the counter for a bottle of Globe Lights. I feel a bit funny because I've never purchased cigarettes. Bat told me to keep some, but not all, of the change. The man gives me three small buckets with ice in them, three plastic cups, and a larger bucket. He says something to me along the lines of, \"Think before you drink and drive.\" I don't hear him clearly, and I jokingly ask him if he said \"Mix your drinks before you drink them.\" The total bill is $1.18. I give the man a $10 bill. He gives me over $15 in change, as if I've paid with a $20 bill. I'm a bit confused, because I'm sure I paid with a $10 bill, but I'm not going to say anything. I go back to the bank teller line. I have a white plastic bag with all the drink buckets and glasses in it. I get up to a teller after some confusion with others in line. My bag is now a cardboard box, about 12\"x4\"x8\" in dimension. I ask the male teller if I can get $200 in travelers' checks. He doesn't know about these, and has to ask someone else. He returns and tells me to go around the corner and ask Dee ___ (I forget). I go around the corner and ask a woman. She shows me to a door that enters into a room where a woman is sitting at a table. The woman at the table is Dee, and she asks if she can assist me in getting travelers checks. I say yes, and ask her how long it takes to order them. She replies that it takes two working days. I think about this: When I'd be able to get the checks, when I'm going back to Woodland, and how I'd coordinate it. It seems rushed, in a time crunch."

There is a large farm/garden area around the house. The family is at home. I see a large shadow of a low-flying plane on the ground. Looking up, I see many planes flying overhead. The planes drop bombs all around. I see the bombs falling and I flee, running back into the field. The place where the bombing occurs seems to be Yardville. The planes circle down and land very quickly. This is an invasion of the country by Nazi-like soldiers with small green fighter planes. I run, and my mom runs, following me. I want to escape the invaders. We run into the cornfield, going west to escape. We run away from roads, into the country, around lakes and ponds, and through some ponds. We jump in one of the ponds to cool off. Kids are playing near some of the water holes. It is getting dark. I am then with my brother Wally, not my mom. We come to a huge rock cliff that is covered with plastic, secured with tape. We walk around the edge of this rock that is at least a few hundred feet in circumference and a hundred feet tall. I find a spot and we slip underneath the tarp where there is an opening. We walk here in an open space, and come to a door. Looking through a small rectangular window in the door I see a large concrete bridge and know there is a town there. The town seems to have a \"saving\" quality to it: it will save or help us in some way. We walk out through the door, going from the rock and water country to the town, and into a city. We walk down stairs. The city we are in is Rome. We cross a rope bridge while two men walk the opposite way across it. We may not be fully clothed. The two men seem to be wearing towels. I'm in a building that seems to be like Brimson, and I realize I'm safe. I see my friend Nat Miller and my uncle Rusty Redding. I talk with Nat about the invasion. He tells me it was either Holland or Germany that invaded. His study abroad program ended early because of the invasion. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He talks about his experience of the invasion. He was in bed masturbating when the invaders landed, and before he knew it they had captured him. They tell me that people have been looking for me since the invasion: I've been missing. I quietly take pride in my escaping the invasion. I am safe in Rome. I think of talking to some psychology professors about the invasion, since I'm here."

I have a drawing of a gorilla in my stack of drawings, which I flip through. I'm in an elevator with Grace. We seem to be on a floor where there is a bad man who wants to capture Grace. He thinks that I'm on his side: that since I'm with Grace that I've captured her. He asks me if I want to bring her back and take care of her, or if he should. I tell him I will, knowing that he has no idea I've duped him and have no intentions of capturing her. I try to catch the man off guard and kick him, to injure, kill, or disable him. My kick is short, and I try to change it into a smoother, more controlled motion so he'll think I'm just joking. I then attack him with all my strength. He has a can of some spray that does serious damage to a person, and a gun. I flight with him, avoiding the spray and kicking the gun out of his hand. Then I'm in an elevator as it closes. This is a terrible position to be in because Grace is outside with the man. He knows I'm in the elevator, and can corner me when I try to get out. There is a big tent in a white bag in the elevator. I dump it out and grab a long aluminum tent pole, which is bent, to use as a weapon. I emerge from the elevator on the same floor as the man, and he attacks. I fight him off. I'm fighting my classmate at Brimson, Arnold, and another short, thin blond haired man. I smash their heads together and smash them on the marble floor of what seems to be a church."

He is fairly dangerous and belligerent. The boy pushes me out onto the beam and pulls the pen that I always carry out of my back pocket. The pan is what will allow me to walk or stand slanted or sideways. I regain my balance and push the delivery boy into the arms of the army man, who is behind him. This seems to be doom or death for the boy. I run! I go away from the army man. I run to my home, go inside, and lock all the doors. I go upstairs, and then go downstairs. The front door is then wide open and the piano is playing by itself, as if an invisible person is playing it. I don't see a person, but someone must be there. I lash out, but touch nothing. I run outside with fear, wondering who or what is there. I see a lamb, a whale, and other objects that appear before my eyes. I get near the back door, where there is a sign. It has writing on it, something like, \"What is chasing me?\", or \"What am I chasing?\" I stop and think: what am I scared of? What part of me am I running from?"

We drive to drop Belinda off, turning into an alley that is near Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I'm home now, but will go back to Melbourne next Saturday, in ten days. I talk about leaving to go back and my dad seems sad. We get out of the car. As we approach home, my mom yells out the door that there is a phone call for Heather. I go and hug Heather goodbye. My dad is walking away in a dejected manner. I catch up with and stop him. We hug each other and cry. I tell him I love him. He says he loves me more than I love him. I want to get my phone number in Melbourne for him. I try to write it on my pocket notepad, but I have difficulty. The numbers I write are messy. I scribble them out. I get the number confused and write the wrong numbers, then scribble them out. I try hard to get correct numbers down clearly, but I can't. I lean the pad up against a wooden post and write the number 6884 9224, which is my number."

I've heard vaguely of one or two; others I'm not familiar with. They are Saft, Ditzen or Dizy, and others. My dad is at a bookstore while we talk. He tells me there will be a reading of these authors at a bookstore on June 5th, 1998. At first I thought he had bought me some books, then he tells me they'll be reading. I'm in the basement pit room at home in Oak Valley talking on the phone. I have several eggs. One egg is cracked, with a blob of egg white hanging out. I tell my dad I'd like to go to the reading but I'll still be in Australia on June 5th. It seems like I haven't left the United States yet. Carl Jung will be there! I really want to go! My dad has reserved two tickets for the reading on his credit card. I tell him I'll try to change my schedule to make it home on June 2nd or 3rd. I remember that the Raden University packet warned against taking exams early. My dad says okay, and our conversation seems about to end. Because of this burst of excitement and enthusiasm I want to tell him the dream I had last night in which he and I told each other I love you. I'm in my mom's bedroom looking north out the east window. I'm about to tell my dad the dream when I see five suns out the window. They are larger than usual: about twice as large as normal, and they are glowing. I stop and look at them. They are brilliant! I tell him to quick look out of his window and I run outside to look. As I run outside I see a reflection in the glass that makes me think that the five suns were really just a tricky splitting of light rays, like a prism. But I feel I can't back down from what I've said, because I've made a big deal of it, so I go out to look. It is cloudy outside. I see the suns as if they were in front of the clouds, large and glowing, in the formation of the five dots on a die. My brother Wally is there with his friends Perry Glyde and Mryle Madden. Perry or Mryle has my pocket notebook. I get it from them and scramble to write, to capture the moment. I see letters, numbers, and symbols on the suns, including 18hr or 18rh. I try to write these down. I'm still on the phone with my dad this whole time. I'm talking loud and fast. I'm very excited about what I'm seeing, as if it is a vision or is prophetic."

I'm there to buy some leg weights so I can do the leg exercises while I'm in New South Wales to alleviate my knee pain. I test the electrical wiring of an item by plugging in several connections. A bulb lights up so I know the wiring is okay. My junior high classmate Ben Kator is there. He says his name and says something to be about getting the store employee who is in the attic. I don't recognize him at first, but then I remember him. The employee comes down from the attic. I wander up to the counter to pay for my leg weights. I have looked at several different sizes and weights. The employee rings it up to a total of $14.80. I start pulling out $24.80, so I can get a $10 bill back. The man grabs a handful of my coins and counts out 80 cents: three quarters and a nickel. He then slides the 80 cents towards him with his left hand and slides another bunch of coins towards him with his right hand, also taking the paper bills. I confront him on this, and call him a thief because I caught him. I say that a few coins aren't a big deal, but he is stealing. I ask him if there is a manager I can talk to. He says yes, and points to an office where I see a blue collar somewhat white trash stressed out greasy alcoholic-type person talking business on the phone. I wait for the manager, standing at the counter with the employee/thief. We talk about hard financial times: stealing while grocery shopping. The employee says that everyone steals. I tell him honestly that I don't. I'm waiting outside the manager's door. The employee enters the office and puts a dollar bill on the desk while the manager is still on the phone, as a bribe. It is the excess money in the till from stealing. He then comes and offers me a $40, $10, and $1 bill to keep quiet. I yell out, \"Don't try to bribe me!\" The manager is off the phone, and is standing right behind me. The employee lost his job at that moment, and leaves. I look at the store, which is on the hill as I look up towards the big oak tree and machine shed at the farm. The store is a mess: very unorganized, and things are falling apart. Three customers approach. The manager will need to run the store. I wait for the manager, to ask him if he needs good help: a good employee. Looking at the mess I know I could be more organized, efficient, and clean. I seem to be around Brimson, and am thinking of this job as a weekend job."

There is a van parked to our right, and a car to our left. Matt has gone in the store. I need to urinate. I look to do this by the car, shielding myself from view.

I'm in the break room at Grocery Getto. I quit my job there, along with another man. The man has some stuff in his locker that belongs to another employee. A coworker, Todd Mohs, is there.

I am deeply saddened, and roll to the floor on my knees, crying. I leave, walking north to Carter Church in Oak Valley, which is a short walk.

We are sharing with this family for now. I set my load down and tell everyone about Jerry's death. I say what Jerry meant to me: that he was a facilitator: he allowed me the extra freedom to do my own thing. We're all having homemade pasta and steak for dinner. Some of the boys from the other family come to introduce themselves to me. One of them is named Tod. Another boy tells me to say \"farmers\" and then he squeezes my cheeks together as I say the \"ers\" portion of the word, so his name sounds like \"Farmears\", but is spelled Farmers. They pick up small, arranged strands of colored pasta from my plate. This is a really artsy, fancy, finicky, almost childish way to prepare pasta, and I'm kind of annoyed by it.

I'm disoriented, and can't find my stand. There are other hunters around. I sit near a stadium field, where there is another hunter. I'm in a hurry, and I don't have a warm hat. I'm told to let the other hunter shoot does. I climb up a tree. The tree bends to the ground, so I am sitting atop of the trunk, which is bent in the shape of an upside-down U. I see a deer running. A shot is fired. Someone has hit it on the run. It doubles back and runs towards me. I fire, but no bullet comes out of the gun: it's like a misfire. The deer runs down towards another hunter, who fires and misses. The deer runs right towards me. I see two figures: a deer and what appears to be a person, running close together. I have a double-barrel shotgun. I aim the gun and fire. The deer falls dead on the spot, half blown apart. People come and look at it. I have shot a boy, maybe in addition to a deer. They may be separate, but the boy seems to have been wearing part of the deer on him as he ran. This is a terrible accident. Others and I feel guilty. I notice the safety on my shotgun is still off."

It seems there is some sort of exchange for the chickens: either getting something for removing them from the house, or for bringing them to the house. I go to the house with four chickens. People I know are watching television. Ernie Els (the golfer) is a short bald man. He is playing basketball against Kareem Abdul-Jabaar. Ernie makes a shot and is going to win.

I think there are only two outs. We're up to bat. My friend Gino Teavor is leading off, followed by my friend Norman Noman, then myself. There are many short, light bats. I look for one to use. I find the old black and gray bat that my brother Wally and I used to have as kids: I really like it. Gino may get on base. Norman hits a two-run homerun over the left field fence, down the third baseline. There is a large metal structure in left field that Gino makes a catch by jumping over. He may have caught a fly ball that he hit. There is a large net stretched across the inner outfield, from left to right field. It effectively prevents any homerun balls. I come up to bat and take two balls. I foul one pitch off to the right, then foul one off to the left. I chase bad pitches that are too fast for me with the intention of crushing one for a homerun. I swing and miss, and think it's the second strike, not remembering one of the foul balls. The catcher points out that I struck out. I realize this, and step away from home plate.

I'm trying to catch the big eel on a rubber cord with a bit of food attached to the end of it. I dive back down. The eel eats the food. The eel is my study abroad coordinator Jessie Sanders. I wonder how I will catch her if there is no hook on the cord: if I pull on the cord it will just come out of the eel's mouth. She eats the food, partially swallowing the cord. I grab her body by the waist and hips and spin her around so the cord wraps tightly around her neck. She resists but is weak compared to my strength.

The man I'm with says we should look into getting more burgers for the night since Martial Law has been declared. I'm with my sister Heather and her friend at home. I tell Heather what Martial Law means. She is surprised and shocked. At one point I'm worried for my own safety and the security of my house and room. I'm on the phone with my mom. I'm talking while standing near a large body of water with a high tower or platform area that my brother Wally and my cousin Archie Weber jump off. My mom is then there. It's a bright sunny morning. Martial Law ended this morning at 6:00 or 7:00 am. My mom says that her sister Elaine Grains went to commit suicide this morning, but didn't go through with it. My dad is there, as is a man operating a boat. We all haul items, at one time carrots and fresh vegetables, across water in a slow and careful process. It takes a while because of the outboard motors and the shallow water. Later, the cargo is two baking pans. I'm in a wood shack near the water. It is a bathroom, but doesn't have the features of a bathroom, like a toilet or sink. I look in the rafters of this shack. I'm in a cottage with a group of people cleaning up after guests. There are moldy bagels there. The guests have left a lot of food in the refrigerator. I want to keep it and eat it. I'm in a hair salon. I see my grade school classmate Karen Kipp. I'm in a place where I see a mother and her two daughters eating sub sandwiches from Subway. At some point I seem to be in a donut shop as well. There is a storage room that I am shown, with others, where I try to fit myself with an appropriate length walking cane. There are televisions around the outer room. A group is gathering. Video games are connected to the televisions."

We take off from a dirt or grass runway and immediately turn to the 12 or 1 o'clock position, which is a very steep, nearly upside down, turn. We all hang on. We are flying to Boston, which is four hours and twenty ___ minutes away (I forget the exact number of minutes). We get up in the air high and can see the town of Boston in the distance, with all its suburbs. We fly over a suburb that extends to a point on a narrow peninsula. There is one private house on the peninsula surrounded by clear turquoise water. The house is obviously owned by wealthy people. It has a swimming pool and a meticulously kept lush green lawn. This is a place or suburb called Owen, and it is Cape Cod, a very nice, posh place to live. I see gourmet snack food delights laid out along the poolside. It is a beautiful place, with blue water and a clear sky. My housemate Glen Ryan is with me. I'm inside the house flipping through the television channels with the remote control. I see images of cartoon characters on the screen of each channel I change to. I realize at some point that the reason for the flight taking over four hours is because, even though we're close to the city, we're making several stops."

When we reach a certain point the instructor flips a switch and the cockpit opens. The two people running in front get in the cockpit as the people in the rear continue to run along the back of the plane. When the front two people are in the plane, then the back two get in. The plane then takes off. All this happens over a very short distance, in tight areas where the plane is being steered through trees and buildings. I'm on the front left side of the plane. We begin to run and Fiona hops in. I climb up to get in but have trouble and see an ominous pillar in front of us that is just at my level, stretched across the makeshift runway. I hop up onto the pillar as we get near it, and the plane goes underneath it. The flight instructor looks back and sees me standing atop the pillar. He gives me a look as if I should have hopped down the other side of the pillar and landed in the plane as it came out from underneath the pillar. But, the plane is turned around and we try again. It's later. I'm in a room with the people I flew with. We have won one of the plane races, maybe because others let us win. It was our first race attempt that we won. I'm happy enough with this. I think we should all take a photograph. Everyone is wearing yellow and blue rain jackets. One of the men is cooking a pot roast in a microwave oven, which is actually an oven. There are fixings with the roast. The man seems like Mick from the university caving club."

It swings and smashes a ghost-like being into a wall or building. The being is made of a skeleton, but is Jell-O-like, smashed. The pendulum breaks through one building, with the flattened figure of the ghost stuck to its end, and smashes into the next building. The ghost-skeleton is severely beaten. The ghost is then the actress Linda Hamilton. She picks herself up and continues on despite the beating. Her name is Wendilot. She is being chased, a spirit may be trying to kill her. I may be one of the spirits chasing her. The goal of Wendilot would be to make a titanium watch for her uncle, who may be helped or cured after 30 or 40 years of illness. He would be able to cure himself. I'm evading Wendilot, staying hidden around my neighbors the Stein's house, and the front sidewalk at home in Oak Valley.

The walking man is lower down in a parking ramp area, where he talks with the speaker. The speaker wants the walking man to falsify kissing and sexual acts. To appease the speaker, the walking man pretends to kiss him, but doesn't ever kiss him on the lips. This seems to be to demonstrate a purpose, for the public, to encourage or advertise somehow. There is a young Asian man and a woman there. The man seems to have just awakened, and the woman comments that he didn't put his hands in his pants nearly as much as she thought he would.

I point out Trout Mountain as we walk: a snow covered peak off to our left. We'll have to walk back to Eagle Lake and then portage to Trout Lake. We walk on an ice and snow covered, plowed, road. On our left is a frozen lake with an ice fishing house on it, as well as other house and huts. We continue to walk north towards Eagle Lake. Cars drive by us on the road. I think this area has really been opened up for use, and I think it's dangerous that the roads are so icy and we're walking against oncoming cars. We continue to walk back towards our group. Our dog is with us. There are many dogs across the road from us. At first I think they may be Timberwolves, but they aren't. We go past several men on snowmobiles. I have a snowmobile then, and I cruise up to the group that is walking towards us. My high school teammate Ron Lind is in the group. He has long hair. I ask my friend Kevin Simpson where to go. We decide to go to Trout Lake. We're all at the public landing at Eagle Lake. It's a beautiful day. Kevin puts a spare key for his truck inside a key holder and places it in my jeans pocket. I think this is a good idea: we'll each have a key then. Kevin's watch says it's 8:30am. My watch says 10:30am. We're heading out with a group of people new to this area: rookies. I'm excited about our trip. I'm very anal retentive about the details of the trip, because I want everything to be perfect. I'm so picky I may detract from people's experience, and my own. I ask my high school classmate Tanya Simmons and another woman where they want to camp tonight: on an island or around here on the shore? They say it makes no difference, but Tanya seems to hint at the shore. I suggest an island because the breeze will keep the bugs away. Our goal is to make it to Trout Lake (on the first day?). I'm really excited about camping on Trout Lake. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling have a big red tent and a red tarp with. One of the women has a big puffy red sleeping bag with no stuff sack or cover for it. I say the one thing that we absolutely need is to stay dry! I make the woman walk down to Fishing Haven and buy some garbage bags. One shore, a man and his son are fishing. The boy, who is three or four, catches a nice smallmouth bass. The bass gets off the hook right near shore, and starts to flop and wriggle back into the water. My brother Wally is knee deep in the water. He grabs the fish as it tries to swim away. They have caught a two-headed fish: the bodies of two fish are connected at the tails. The fish is going to die. I try to revive it. It is a white platypus-like fish at one end and a smallmouth bass or a northern pike at the other end. I can't revive the fish. I think of getting my knife, to cut the tails and save one of the two fish, but they can't be revived. I'm meticulous and anal retentive about all the details and everyone's packing. I want everyone to have a good trip, and am looking out for those who haven't experienced this before. I realize I may be overbearing."

I don't sing along, but it seems like another American person I know does sing along: maybe my friend Niles Zelling. I walk with my friend Stephen Ramos and another man. I'm then crawling on my stomach on the ground. Approaching us is a man, and behind him is an older couple. I get up and walk when we pass them because I would feel embarrassed crawling by the man. I'm near the Uptown Theatre. The old couple is there; I talk with them. The man is wearing an akubra. I ask them, \"Didn't I see you on the way home from Australia?\" The man says yes: they were on the same plane as I. We talk briefly. I ask them how their holiday was. The man offers to take me hunting. I'm happy and surprised, and ask, \"What do you hunt?\" He answers, \"Tobacco.\" I'm surprised by this, but will give it a try. I tell him I'll give him a call or stop by later: he only lives down Home Avenue in Oak Valley, just south of 2nd Street. I walk over to the movie theatre. I hold a rolled cigarette in my hand as I walk. I see my brother and his friend Mryle Madden, and greet them. Mryle is terse. He is three or four inches taller than I. He has a drink, but doesn't want to drink tonight, so I get his drink and consume most of his Screwdriver. I give it back to him, saying that the orange juice is sour. He agrees. I see my high school classmate Justin Michaels with a false razor blade cut on his left cheek and artificial blood on his face, in the triangular shape of pork chop side burns. I walk over to the movie ticket line. A woman who is above the line in a balcony-like area or on a roof, yells out to me that I'm going to throw up. I know this is asinine. I had one drink in a few seconds, and I hold a lot more alcohol than that before I get sick. I walk through the line to get up to a group of people I know, because one person waved at me earlier when I was standing next to Wally and Mryle. I carry liquid in a cup or bowl. I'm careful not to spill it. I walk past many familiar faces, including my high school classmate Helen Cullen. I see a person who looks like my childhood friend Helen Vader. I say to her, \"Helen Vader?\" She turns and acknowledges me: it's her. Behind her is her brother, Trevor, whom I haven't seen in many years. We shake hands. He is tall, and has put on weight. He ahs darker brown greasy hair, and glasses. Another woman there shakes my hand, and introduces herself as Helen Burger: a friend of mom's. We all talk. Someone comments about me coming to a movie by myself: they are impressed. I try to think of what movie to see; all the movies look unfamiliar to me. I see the title for a Simpson's movie, and I don't know if it's about the television cartoon family the Simpson's, but I go to it anyway. The movie begins like the television show. Homer Simpson is in the bathtub, and he puts Bart in charge for the day so he can masturbate with a bar of soap while in the tub. It seems to be me in the tub: I see myself there."

I say that was the game in the second round of the playoffs that we beat our cross-town rivals. He indicates he was at the game. I say, \"Oh, glory days...\" He doesn't seem to understand what I mean by that, so I repeat it and explain what I mean, but then he seems to understand, so I stop. I ask him what he does. He says he's an NFL scout. We talk as if he missed an opportunity by not recruiting me when I was in high school. We talk about New York.

My friend Becky Muldoon and another woman are living there as well. The man has meat sitting out on the counter ready to cook. Becky, the woman, and I are about to cook a breakfast of eggs. I'd like hash browns as well. The midget has ordered light bulbs to be delivered to our place to replace the ones that burned out in the flat. The delivery and bulb costs are our expense. We are all upset at the man because of this. We tell him that we don't need to have all the bulbs in place until our flat inspection on May 14th. We are angry, but try to express our feelings tactfully. The delivery man arrives driving a white truck, which he parks in the alley- I'm at home now in Oak Valley. The delivery man comes in with three light bulbs and the midget pays him $14. We feel angry because we had no choice in the decision-making. Even though the midget paid, somehow, we are paying for this. The delivery man and the midget leave. The midget stays for a bit outside on his motorcycle-like vehicle. I take the bulbs. One is five or six inches in diameter. I hold it from the bulb portion and inadvertently dent it by squeezing it: it is malleable. The filament falls apart, away from the rest of the inside of the bulb. The midget is watching us from his motorbike outside the window. I tell the others that I've broken the large bulb by squeezing it, and I feel stupid for this. They tell me that a hair-thin thread is still connecting the base of the bulb and the filament, and the bulb is still good if I take a piece of cardboard and form it around the filament to protect the side of the bulb from the heat of the filament. I look and see the hair-thin filament. I realize the cardboard would probably burn up. Two other men arrive in the driveway and are talking to the midget. One man has a briefcase and a load of papers under his arm. He is coming to our door to advertise or sell something about fishing, we think. I tell the others I'll talk to him and tell him politely to go away. He comes to the back door. My sister Ramona and my friend Gretchen Warwick each run to the door, tell him rudely to go away, and then run away from the door. I walk out onto the porch to talk to him and tell him we're not interested in what he has. I invite him into the porch because it's cold outside. I ask if he's selling something. He indicates I should come with him, so I do, wearing socks but no shoes. He wants me to come out to his orange camper-like vehicle that has a high roof in the rear, which is parked in our driveway. He tells me he's been living in his vehicle about a month waiting for me. I'm disturbed by this, and ask him what he wants. He starts to explain to me that my parents entered into a contract with him. In this contract they paid him a good deal of money so that I would be taught about computers; to be married to computers. The money that was paid to him was used to buy a computer, which is now at his house being used for storing his information, documents, and files. At first I don't understand and am disturbed by what he is saying. I ask him questions to clarify, and then I understand. I'm very disgusted and angry. We're standing next to the plum tree in the back yard. I say to the man, \"Go back and sit in your car. If I get confirmation of this (from my mom, who isn't here at the moment, I think) I'll come out, apologize for being harsh, shake your hand, and we'll talk. If I find out there is no bond, I'll come out, shake your hand, and ask you to leave.\" I think of my choice of words: I'm deliberately polite and concise. I'm very loud, firm, assertive, and aggressive. The man is shorter than I, and he is balding. He's a businessman. I bump him as we talk. As I leave, he says to me, \"Your checks are good. You're pushing me around like a Swan Ball.\" He means that I'm strong, firm, decisive, and assertive. Before I go inside I get up close to him and say loudly and threateningly, \"A contract is only legal if both persons are not coerced into signing it.\" I head for the back door. There is a group with the man now. I deliberately bump into one of the group, to tell him to leave. I'm in a very belligerent and disgusted mood. I go inside feeling flustered."

My dad is loud, laughing, and is carrying my friend Reed Maxwell's tent, which he gives to a man thinking he is returning it. My dad is fairly out of control: laughing and talking. He says someone in the room must have the farts. At a table that is turned 90 degrees from the one I was sitting at first, I sit with a group of people and play poker. I have four 7's in my hand. I bet \"four-of-a-kind\", which is a very strong bet! There are several cards in the middle of the table face up. Of these cards, two or three are 7's.

The shark will have to be cut up and processed in a wooden shack where we have dragged it. It is big: about 20 feet long."

I drop raisins or black currants from my left hand onto his face. This agitates him, and though I was joking around, I may have crossed the line. It's raining hard outside. I'm on the porch of the Whitman house, which is different. Items are scattered about, messily. A young couple in their mid to late teens are sitting outside next to a tree. The girl comes over, grabs a piece of paper and a pen from the porch, and goes back. I hear her comment on the messy kitchen and the clean rooms inside the house. She means the porch but calls it the kitchen. A squirrel runs up my leg and onto my back, under my shirts! I'm very anxious and scared about this because the squirrel could bite me. I feel it on my back: it is jittery and nervous. I want to get the squirrel off my back. Other people are there. I take my shirts off. The squirrel may leave."

        "dream_content": "Commando HansonI'm on a bus with a group of armed soldiers for military purposes. I'm a black man that looks like the character Dillon from the movie Predator. I, the black man, am called Hanson. At times I see this man, and at other times I feel his motion and move as him. I ask the man in front of him (I), who is Hanson, for weapons, because he (I) has (have) none. The man sitting in the seat next to me gives me a grenade launcher with a red laser bead scope and an automatic machine gun that looks like a rifle and has two triggers, about eight inches apart, on the stock. We ride. I drop one of my guns on the floor: it's a bumpy ride. I pick it up and am then more careful with the guns, putting the safety buttons on. We approach a man on our left. He is in a tree with a clay target thrower. He has five bright orange clay targets lined up, one by one, in the thrower. This seems to be the usual: we never do anything about it. But he usually only has one or two targets lined up, not five. This time when we pass a white man sitting a few seats in front of me stands up with an automatic rifle to shoot the targets. He waits until the trajectory of the targets is perpendicular to the length of the bus. At this time, the man in the tree flings five targets at once, and the soldier demolishes the line of targets with his rifle. Immediately we see the man throwing the targets is no longer there: he must be wounded, shit! We stop the bus and look around the area without getting off the bus. We can't see him or his body. This must be some kind of trick, and the man is our enemy. We are a hard-core military unit. We are in dense bush country. A woman is with us driving a small bulldozer. She clears the way for our bus to make the necessary turns. She clears a path through the jungle for our powerful, specially designed bus. We continue on. I'm riding in the bucket of a large yellow bulldozer that seems to be what the unit is then riding in. The bucket is raised high up and tilted so I can sit in it and not be seen. I may be able to help the unit as a spy by keeping a low profile here while the main unit rides below. I have the grenade launcher with me, and a gun below with the group. I accidentally drop the grenade launcher. I want to ask the others to hand me my other gun, but then I would expose my hiding spot. I pull two bananas out from the outside of the bucket, behind me. We approach a more elevated area with a trough-like waterslide in the ground that is slippery and muddy. We may be going by plane now as we approach this land. I use hand motions to direct the position of the vehicle to drop me. I indicate to slow down and get closer to the ground. I land, and am dropped off. I will try to rescue my unit from the spy type person that is a threat to us: he may be an assassin. I slide down the water slide, which turns to metal. It is very curvy, with overhangs in some places where people have hit their heads and seriously injured themselves. This slide may be named \"Spiral\". I slide on a banana, which makes me go faster. I know that I'm not the first person to experience the slide. I also know not very many people have experienced this. As I approach the bottom of the slide I seem to know or be told by a narrator that there will be water. I slide in slowly, trying to slow down so I don't get really wet, into a few inches of water. I'm in a laboratory-like area. There is a coffee lounge and several televisions. A teacher is there. It is an academic/research setting. Hanson says, \"What the hell is going on here?\", because he is expecting to find something more covert and militant. The teacher there has no idea what Hanson is talking about, and goes about his business with a cup of coffee or a snack. On one of the televisions an announcer says that \"Hanson has brought the Lions to only three Super Bowls.\""

I fire at the deer. It flinches and jolts its body, so I think I've hit it. We all seem to gather a short time later. I say I saw four deer near the pine trees. All of the deer were relatively small, hardly any with antlers: some small does and fawns. I walk with my friend Gretchen Warwick. We go after deer, to a forested area.

After looking for the right path, I climb straight up. The holds are thin aluminum-like holds. I make it 2/3 of the way up, where the roof meets the side of my home. I'm climbing on the side of my home in Oak Valley. I stop when I reach the roof, hanging on, putting my butt into the wall. I put my hand and foot in small door-like openings: holds. I don't climb on the roof because it's rotting. I easily tear off a piece of dead rotting wood, soggy and decaying. There are wooden steps running up to the side of the house to an entrance at the level where I am. I climb over and down, onto and over steps, to climb down the other side of them. The steps are rotting wood, with pieces missing. Some steps are decaying with rusty nails protruding from them. I carefully cross over this dangerous staircase to the other side where I'll climb down. I fall 15 or 20 feet into the soft leaves that have collected on the ground. Wally has not kept the rope that is holding me tight. I'm okay. Wally has big puffy green mittens for climbing. Doug let me use his chalk for my sweaty hands.

He has several attendants looking after him. He explains his statements, three or four of which seem contradictory. I use large orange or yellow garbage bags to \"parachute\" my way down stairs as I walk. The man, who is a convict, is locked in. Another woman and I lock the basement doors to keep him inside, and then we run upstairs, inside. I kick or slam a door very hard. Something about the convict is frightening. There is a plane outside with two ski-like apparatus' on the bottom, curved upwards. It takes off near the house and spins in circles as it flies close to the ground. It is a very maneuverable plane. It lands and takes off again, going through a wooded area over a tin shed. I hear the engines pick up as it does this. I'm at home in Oak Valley near my neighbors the Stein's driveway looking into a window in our home, which seems to be where our driveway is. I'm with another person. We spy in the dark. I have a shotgun. My uncle Dannie Redding and others inside see us. Dannie indicates this by pointing three of his fingers, since I'm with two people. The three of us split up and run. I go into the old garage door, just while Dannie, who is like my uncle Brian Vincent but is a different relative, comes out. We greet each other, though I was trying to avoid him, to spy. He picks up four wooden stakes and asks me for an onion. I look around, and after unloading the six bullets in my shotgun, point him in the direction of some homegrown onions. I go inside. My aunt Sherry Redding is there. I ask my brother Wally and my mom, who are cooking chicken for dinner, what time dinner will be ready.

I'm tagged. I crawl on the floor, giving people a slow count to ten to run away. A short Asian woman is there. She has chin length curly thick dark hair and is wearing lipstick. She is in distress. There is another taller woman there. The two women are standing in a room about 30 feet apart facing each other. The Asian woman is troubled because she is a woman: because she \"has a vagina\", she tells other women. The taller woman says, \"I have a vagina too...\" but there is an adjective the taller woman uses to describe her vagina that is different from the first woman. This adjective may be 'moister' or 'thinner', both meaning more sexually alluring. My classmate Theresa Jamison jokes that I'm a murderer of two people. The area is dark and seems stage-like. The Asian woman, who I think has been wearing a silver dress, is sleeping on the floor. I have a sword. I kill the woman by cutting the floor around her. The floor is a wooden grate-like vent. I cut the pieces of wood in between the holes of the vent. I kill this woman because her father would kill himself if he found out that she is a woman. She is dressed like a man. Blood from her heart drips onto the floor. Theresa jokes that I'm a killer, and will stab her in her sleep, and she will be too scared to scream. I approach Theresa, who is sleeping on a small blue loveseat. She is covered in blue blankets. I have the sword. I cut her several times, shallowly: about one inch deep. I have trouble manipulating the sword to make deep cuts. She awakens and realizes what she said is true: I'm stabbing her and she is too scared to scream. I inflict deeper wounds, stabbing her in the chest, killing her. Blood spurts on the knife I then have, and on the floor. The knife is 12-18 inches long, but isn't a sword. I move her body so it's back on the couch, fully in the sleeping position under the blankets. I think of concealing the body more by sliding it into the sizeable gap between the back of the couch and the couch cushions, but I don't. I know people will find the bodies in a few days and I want this. I don't want to hide the bodies. I'm conscious of my actions.

I walk into the kitchen at the Redding farm. It is dimly lit. It's very early morning. I'm wearing sunglasses. I take them off and can see a bit better then. There are several cats walking on the floor. I put the knife in the sink near the washer and dryer. The music is still playing very softly. I'm a murderer of two, as Theresa joked."

        "dream_content": "The Chocolate Factory WomanI'm in a phone booth about to call the cute brown-haired woman I saw on the chocolate factory tour. I look outside the booth and I see her, her blond-haired friend, and my friend Stephen Ramos. Stephen is a couple with the blond woman. Later, I know he is with woman number 279, which is now number 320. I walk over to them in a friendly manner. They're dressed nicely. The cute brown-haired woman is wearing a short skirt with a matching top and heeled open-faced shoes, all of which seem to be tan/orangish-brown. I notice she has braces. I don't mind this. She's very attractive. The four of us start to walk. I hold the cute woman's hand, then put my arm around her. She's very receptive, and holds my hand and puts her arm around me. I'm surprised at the ease with which we hit it off. She's obviously attracted to me, as I am to her. It's odd walking with my arm around her: not the most comfortable way to walk. But it's all right, and we continue. We're walking in snow then, going north on the west side of Home Avenue in Oak Valley, past my neighbors the Trammell's house. I see the brown station wagon in our driveway and know my mom is home. We get closer to our front steps. There is about three inches of fresh powder snow. I'm barefoot. I open the rear passenger side door of the station wagon, which is parked on Home Avenue facing south on the west side of the road. I climb in and grab my red and gray wool socks for my feet. We're all going to walk to a movie theatre. I ask the girls if they want me to grab them a pair of socks, since they're wearing none. They say no. We walk to the movie. I talk with Stephen about deer hunting. We're in a building about to walk south towards Jose Ramos' deer stand at the Ramos' property. The speed of a bullet must be programmed into a small electronic device on the wall before we start walking. Both of the women have cigarettes: they smoke. This doesn't seem too aversive to me: it seems to be something I could tolerate. I'm a bit past the building out in a pasture with cows. I have two lit cigarettes in my hands. I blow through them, not breathing in any of the smoke. I don't really want to smoke them, but they're not as aversive as I would expect them to be. My acquaintance Gordie is there, smoking. We walk to Jose's deer stand, then back along through the trees and forest. I'm watching a movie of a gunfight in which two men turn and face each other, about to fire. I've seen this movie before. One of the men is shot, but not by his opponent, but by another, miniature, man. He is shot several times. One man is shot in the eye, leaving a large hole there, like in the movie Terminator 2. The cute woman comes over and sits next to me. She is warm. I see a red scar on her belly. I'm happy to be with her: It's been a long time since I've had a sexual encounter. I talk giddily, nonsense. I want to say something because I feel good to be with her. I act goofy and say I'm always cold. We kiss. Immediately I can tell she is a good kisser. I try to kiss well. She sticks her tongue very far inside my mouth. I gag, and feel paralyzed, like I can't open or close my mouth. Her tongue is then her finger. I bite her finger, in what seems like a natural reaction because I couldn't breathe or move. I cut her finger with my teeth, I see, when she pulls it out of my mouth. It is a wide, deep, long cut on the side of her knuckle. I didn't mean to bite her."

Mike says that after their baby went to bed at 9am they got some rest. We may be the woman her tool. I'm down on the dock with my friends Jerry Parsons and Tom Olson. It's an overcast, chilly day. Jerry looks cold. I ask him if he wants a shirt. He says yes. I then realize I don't have any extra shirts, and I tell him I'll give him mine when I get done with work. There is a 44-foot whit boat, which Tom, and then Jerry, get in. There is a smaller 12-foot boat with a motor. Mike pulls the smaller boat up on the left side of the dock. He runs the motor to get the fishing line out of it. The motor spits out a long thin strand of line. When it's done, I pick the line up. The curling, slinky-like strand of line is apple peel.

Patrick is hitting hard line drives. A few vehicles circle around and stop near the park. They are city vehicles: the men have come to tell us not to play on the field. I ask one of them men to see his bill showing the amendment that says we can't play here. He pulls out a sheet with his photograph and a bunch of signatures on it. I ask when it was passed, to see if it is in effect. He says it was passed on fifth. He then says, \"In nine and a half minutes you should all go over to Chickenfeed, if you know what I'm saying.\" I understand him to mean that we have ten minutes to leave, of which a half-minute has already elapsed. Also, by going to Chickenfeed, which is a building near the Hill Lodge, we may play at a different place: it will allow us to keep playing. I think of Sundial Park and the Little League Park, trying to figure out what he could mean for a place to play. I don't understand where we could, but he's implying there's a way we can get around the law and play. A person arrives on a tall old white 10-speed bicycle. Another man arrives in a big white 4x4 truck. The two people are my classmates Bud Slick and Kory Reynolds. My classmates Mike Brimms and Jesse Dockens arrive. I tell them meekly that we can't play.

The can was then moved from the sidewalk/steps of the house to the middle of the southbound lane of Home Avenue, by one of the gangs. Cars swerve to avoid it, and go off the road. Several cars crash. Soon there is a long pile-up of cars. I'm outside in the front yard. I yell for the people inside to call the police, and I run out to the cars. I see if people are okay. Several people are shaken up. I tell them not to move: the police are on their way. A crowd has gathered to see the half-block long pileup. When the police officers arrive I walk up to talk to them first, since I was an eyewitness. I tell them what happened, and about the gangs fighting. I surreptitiously put the blame on one of the gangs, the gang which wasn't at my house, to exonerate myself from guilt. The police seem to think that searching for the gang is futile.

One of them comments, \"I should've known that he'd be here...\" I help the boy, starting to screw in three bolts. Nate says, \"So, how was it?\" He means my study abroad in Australia, from which it seems I have now returned. \"It sucked\", I say facetiously, and then crack a smile.

There are two or three slam-dunks, one by a really tall man and another by a shorter but stronger man. It's a fast-paced game. At halftime my friend Nat Miller leaves. I head out to his car with him. My friend Matt Yams has gotten in the game. I cheer for him. He has short hair. Nat and I agree to play basketball at 10:30am tomorrow morning with my acquaintance Kevin Valley and maybe others. I go back inside. I feel like I'm the center of attention when I walk in. The team is wearing red warm up jerseys. Coach Shooter Jackson is wearing one over his suit."

I say that he can avoid work and loans while getting paid. He doesn't believe me, or he thinks it is not a good, practical idea. We talk more. A fat lady comes in the room and sits down. She has talc/powder on her fat. Ray may be there. The lady says she is hungry. I see it's 10:30pm. I think: no wonder she's fat if she eats a lot late at night. They haven't eaten dinner yet. The lady has a bag of strawberry flavored hard candy. She and Ray eat some. I decline to eat any, though she never really offered me any. I know Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills from Fishing Haven are near. They may be in the next room. I hear baby noises faintly, and I think Mike and Phoebe may have had a child."

It's possible that all three could end up in the same competition, on the same day, at the same time, in the same place, etc.... This would be interesting and unique, and for them, maybe monumental. This possibility seems to be a big deal.. They all sit on a couch. Ramona is on the left, Heather in the middle, and the other woman on Heather's right. Family members sit in between each of them. I note their eyebrows. Ramona's eyebrows are connected, and form the shape of a sine wave. Heather's eyebrows are meticulously plucked and arched, very thinly. The third woman's eyebrows are also connected, but they are not smooth like Ramona's: there is a jagged patch of eyebrow above the bridge of her nose. I view them on the couch from about fifty feet away."

I tell them briefly that he got kicked out and is living in his truck. They seem concerned, so I elaborate: four men moved into the house without signing a lease because Kevin's father didn't have a renter's license because he wanted to evade taxes. Then Jose Ramos left, so Kevin's father Dilbert evicted the rest of them. I portray Dilbert as a greedy, unloving father. My dad is there. He says he is very proud of my siblings and I for the way we act. He says he's embarrassed of his own actions when compared to ours: we are caring, selfless, compassionate, and loving. I hug him, and we cry. I say I love him very much and that he means a lot to my siblings and I. He seems to be feeling belittled when compared with his kids, but we don't think so, and tell him this."

Ahead of me in the distance I see the outline of several aboriginal figures watching me from behind trees. An aboriginal man approaches me from behind and on my right. He is completely gray: covered in ash. I feebly try to speak in a way to which he is accustomed: my attempt to use aboriginal jargon. I say, \"G'day mate, 'the native'?\" This is a greeting and inquiry. He understands me and replies, speaking English. Other aborigines come forth. We're camping. Four or five of the men are white, and my age. They have joined the group. I wonder about their background and homes, but I don't think it's right to ask them about it because that would degrade their status as aborigines. One of the young men talks of a septic tank, and others comment on holes for fecal disposal. Another man talks about Chai tea. When he asks, I say there is tea where I come from. There is a large fire; it is dark out. There are several large pieces of wood in the fire, and the coals are red hot. I add more wood on top of these. I dump water out near the sleeping area, and then realize I should have dumped it away from camp. I dumped some on my sleeping mat. I kneel down and, upon opening my sleeping bag, see that there are many ants in it."

I decide I could steer better if I used the handlebars, so I grasp them. The bicycle is an old 10-speed, with fat tires. I go down the alley behind the \"A\" house on Bauer Avenue. I encounter my dad, who is working in the garage of a house near the \"A\" house. He is repairing a wheel chair over his lunch break and has to go back to the hospital soon to work.

We walk from it, seemingly leaving the area, maybe when we're not supposed to leave. A siren goes off when we are leaving and we start running. I come to a large house on a small hill.

The men are about 30-40 years old, six feet tall, and 180-200 pounds: average males, maybe a bit bigger. I'm trying to fly. I'm concerned about not being able to fly and landing hard. I put on knee and shin pads, and am looking for the best suitable spot in the house to jump: out of a window or something. I'm back with the men. There may be another person there. The man my age doesn't seem too fond of his father's behavior. The men turn, and I see them from the front, partially, whereas before I only saw them from behind.

When I am next to be served the lunch lady begins to serve people in line after me: she serves several Asian students and then a mentally retarded student. I wait, trying to be patient and pleasant, saying nothing. The lunch lady then serves me a rectangular slice of greasy pizza, with crumbled beef in it. I also get a slice of white bread. I take my yellow tray to the line. I stop to take a blue carton of skim milk from the large white cooler. As I do this I see my grade school classmate Tim Nimen. He is tall, with longer, brown straight hair. He says, \"Hey!...\" I say, \"Hi Tim\", in a very reserved manner, and continue on. My lunch is rather small, I think, but I'll eat it. I walk out to the cashier. There is some chaos near the cashier: several people are there just standing around. The cashier is attending to something else. I stand there a bit. Since there's no one to pay, I think of punching my own lunch ticket. I don't have a token. I turn and face the commons to go eat. Immediately many people surround me, talking to me, and shouting out. They make a big deal that I'm back. I recognize many faces: My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles, a guy named Brice or Brady, and many others. I sit down and others join me. Sonya is on my left. She comments on something to do with her breasts: how she will never do that again, implying changing her breasts. While she says this she lightly pounds her chest, one breast with each fist. I understand her to be saying that she's content with small breasts. She takes the middle of my piece of bread sneakily. When I see this I quickly eat the rest of my lunch, because it's small. I wiggle my front lower right tooth. I think I should drink a few more cartons of chocolate milk, for the calcium. The milk I had with my lunch was chocolate, though it was skim when I took it."

A shot of lemon-ish liquid is put on the table and one has to suck or lick t off the table and then chase it with a lemon-flavored chaser in a glass with a straw. The man arrives and joins us. The biggest problem, I find, is not doing the shot itself, but having enough wind power to suck it all up off the table. My high school friend Nelson Eastman comes up: he is a waiter and is clearing the table. I'm with a man whom I'm friends with from high school; we both know Nelson and ask for free drinks. Nelson says he could probably help us, and asks how much we want to drink. I say as much as possible. When I say this I notice Nelson's boss has walked up behind him! Our attempt to get free drinks may be foiled. Nelson rolls his eyes as he walks away from his boss. We still may get free drinks if his boss didn't catch the gist of the conversation. I get up and walk around. The pub has quickly become crowded. The people I was sitting with have moved or left and others have taken over the table. I see my high school classmates Donald Dilson and Nathan Plumber. I walk around. A woman walks past me from behind and taps her fingers on my back as she does, indicating she doesn't like it when people do that to her: she thinks I walked past her and tapped her on the back a moment before. In fact, I didn't. It must have been a different man clandestinely hitting on her. I see a blondish woman at a table. I think I hear my name, but when I look she doesn't notice me. She looks a bit like my friend Sarah Reed or Helen Vader. I see my high school teammate Shawn Salzburg and his brother Brent, standing together next to a wall. I go talk to them. Both have long, stringy goatees, like mine, but about four to six inches long. Brent's is especially long. My teammate's father Greg Kulik is there with us. He is standing close, facing me. I jokingly pretend to knee him in the groin. After, I think that isn't the kind of personality I want to be displaying. I talk with the Salzburgs about basketball. Shawn says he's playing for the local youth hostel association. Brent's girlfriend yells at him because he's drinking and has a heart murmur: he could die. He says he's not on the drugs anymore, so he can drink. He is close to me, and I get specks of saliva in my face as he talks. I tell Shawn that my basketball playing days are over. While I talk with them I see a short stone bridge. It rises sharply in an arch over the water to be bridged."

He jumps on tables, which seems to elicit a hostile response from the others. He jumps down, in their midst, and they fight. He has two-inch claws. I help him fight. He is a good fighter: strong and quick, and can fend off several adversaries. I smash one person on the side of the head with a rock or melon. Barbel Inhelder is there. Her head is a melon, though the melon and her head are separate. Whatever happens to the melon happens to her head. I hold the melon.

There is a large cream-colored phone on the table. I pick it up. It is 14-15 inches long. It has earpiece holes, but no mouthpiece to speak into. I say \"Hello, with whom am I speaking?\" I see Bubba on another phone, and know it's him I'm joking around talking to. A woman's voice is on the phone.

This is moose territory. We arrive at the huge dead tree we have been walking towards. It's dead but has leaves. It's hundreds of meters tall, at least 40 feet in diameter, and it shoots straight upward: a massive, cylindrical trunk! There are no leaves or branches below about 100 meters, like a eucalypt. I stand at the base of the tree and look up: the tree is immense: absolutely huge! Others in the group and I want to set up some kind of structure or habitat in this huge tree trunk. I see a notch cut around the tree, about a foot deep: just a scratch in a tree this big. We try to figure out how we can get up to the point high up on the trunk to begin our work. It is 90 meters to the base of the foliage. We only have 70 meters of rope. I see the dining room at home, and the metal hooks attached to the wooden ladder-like plant holder. I think if we can tie the rope between the hooks, or from hooks to stretch across the open space, then we'll be able to grapple our way out to the tree, like a tightrope. I see the immense tree bend and sway with the wind. The trunk cracks and falls. Huge triangular chunks of wood pour down like rain. They are about 10 feet tall and just as wide, and weigh tons. I take cover. They are parts of the tree. Two of our group members are at the base of the tree when these fall. I fear that they will be crushed by the immense chunks of wood, and I frantically look for them. The wood chunks are still unstable, and could roll over or shirt, easily crushing a human. I don't find the bodies of the two. I'm in the basement at home in Oak Valley. Fifty-gallon drum-shaped rock boulders drop from above me, all around. I am scared of being crushed and may take a way out, through the pit room. I think this may be a chain reaction: from falling tree chunks to boulders. In the basement I though the danger was gone, but it continued, and rocks fell near the base of the steps."

I'm surprised to get paid eight-to-one for the full house. Geoff draws a few cards. I see the draws three 4's, and that he has a four in his hand, for four 4's, which beats me! I'm a bit confused, because this has been divided into two hands, and though he has four 4's, I'm still going to get paid for my full house, because they occur on different hands."

As she does, she sees I am masturbating and comments that I'm always masturbating. She goes out, leaving the door about a foot open. I'm sitting on a bed with my pants down to my knees. My sister Ramona comes in. She stays for a bit. I try not to look like I'm masturbating, which is hard when my pants are down. Finally I say to her, \"Ramona, will you give me a minute?\", to indicate that I want to finish masturbating. She leaves. I'm giving myself fellatio. I manage to crouch over far enough to suck the tip of my penis, then get it a bit farther into my mouth. I suck for a while; it is mildly pleasurable. I notice my erection has shrunken. It is like a balloon that is stretched out but wrinkly and deflated. There is much loose, plastic-like skin and my penis is thin and rubbery: flaccid like a rolled out piece of play dough. I try to re-establish an erection, to inflate my penis, but it is to no avail."

My friends Stephen Ramos, Virginia Green, Virginia's sister, and my sister Ramona are there. Virginia comes up to me when I first see her, and says something about how she always was attracted to me in high school. I'm uncomfortable and don't know now to reply. The night continues. In the morning I awaken at a place with many people, all of whom have stayed overnight. Some of the people are going to Herman or Johnsonville. I notice the faces of several people from the university in Melbourne. I see my acquaintances Wendy, Joe, and Amanda from the Backcountry Trail. That morning I'm walking with Stephen. We seem to be leaving. I ask him if Virginia was really there last night, or if it was a dream, because it left me feeling uneasy. He laughs and says it was real. I think, then, of another situation that I was in, and wonder if it was a dream. But I don't ask Stephen because I'm not sure it was."

His face is covered in bits of toilet tissue: he has really cut himself badly when shaving. Then the bits of tissue are gone. I ask him how this year's team is doing. He says pretty shitty.

        "dream_content": "Meeting PersonI'm catching chickens. I wander through several large rooms with corridors between them. There seems to be an underwater feeling to the rooms. I go into a room where two familiar women are peeling shrimp, as a job. They ask me if I want one. I ask them if it's okay, and they say any of us can eat all we want. I think this is like the chocolate factory I visited. I ask if the shrimp are cooked, and the woman says yes. So I peel a shrimp and eat it.I'm on a plane flying over a city. It's dusk. I look out to my left where the chicken barns would be. The barns are smaller: about the size of a city plot of land for a house, and are close together, connected. There is water, a bay or a river, that the city is built along. I lay down on the left wing of the plane (from the point of view of being in the plane facing forwards). I'm out at the tip of the wing, and I hold on to the edge. We fly over the city. It's dark and the city lights shine beautifully. The plane begins to turn and I feel unstable in my position on the wing. An arm reaches up and touches me on the left side of my head. I'm wearing my green wool hat. I realize that I've been lying down on the person whose arm touched me. I see she is fair skinned and has thick straight shoulder length blond hair. She reminds me a bit of my friend Emily Zates. She doesn't mind that I'm laying on her. She is lying on her stomach too. She indicates for me to hold on as the plane turns, and I do. The plane soars to the right, coming in fast for a landing. It gets close to the ground, and slows, and it seems the plane will be thrust forward and upwards, but it lands, unexpectedly to me. A red station wagon-like car is in place of the front wheels of the plane. There are several inches of fresh snow on the runway. The woman and I are low to the ground and let go of the plane when we can do so safely: without being in danger of being hit or run over by the plane. I feel peaceful, happy, adventurous, and free. An old couple is then driving the car that was the landing gear. The woman introduces herself as \"Person\". I think this may be spelled Pearson or Person, but is pronounced like the noun 'person'. I introduce myself as \"Kenneth\". I'm very happy to meet her. She is a very attractive person in many ways. We walk where the snow is deeper to get back to the airport terminal from the runway. She has bare feet. I'm wearing sandals with no socks. My feet are warm. A white car drives along side of us. Three young men in it ridicule us for no apparent reason. Person runs up to the car and hops in the sliding door on its left side. I follow and jump on. This surprises the guys inside. One of them says his name is Gabe. He tells me he's going to the airport to pick up (my friend) Gretchen Warwick. I tell him matter-of-factly that I know Gretchen: we were on a study-abroad program together. I introduce myself to him. The airport is a large open area. We wait. Some of the guys ask about my green hat. I tell them it's wool, and it's warm. Gabe asks me to drive my acquaintance Bill Vanderbil home because Bill and Gretchen don't get along in the car. I'm nervous about driving, but then he just asks me to hold the keys, which is fine with me. My friend Jennifer Valentine is there. She talks to me, saying, \"I can't believe you laid on her and didn't know she was there!...\" I see Person , who is with the woman that came to the airport to get her. She is standing a few hundred feet away from me, about to leave the airport area. We make eye contact and wave at each other: there is a mutual attraction to each other, not necessarily physical, though that may be present. I'm attracted to her person: who she is. Though she is far away, I hear her voice. She is describing what I look like so that she can point me out to the person I am with. I'm wearing my baggy 8th grade Union Bay jeans and the green wool hat. I have on my turquoise chamois cotton shirt with some shirts underneath it. I unbutton my turquoise shirt so person has some description of me to relate to her friend. As I do this I hear her saying, \"He's unbuttoning his shirt...\", identifying me."

I tell her this is how unpeaceful it is here: harsh language, conflict, hatred, anger, which all occurs in silence. I walk out the porch door. To my left I see Seaside Hill. The base is visible but the peak is in clouds. I realize I'm dreaming because Seaside Hill is not near the Redding farm. I fly around the farmyard, slowly and low to the ground. I see the black and white cat that roamed the neighborhood of my flat in Coverton, and often visited the flat. I land and call the cat over to me. It doesn't come at first. I try to use my will power to make it come over to me. It comes closer, and is about ten feet away. I don't force it to come any closer: I try to respect the cat's wishes. I sit there a while with the cat nearby. I think about the cat: what it's doing, what, and who it is. I tell the cat that I'll see it again."

An orangutan is on the court, or I see one. It or someone makes fun of Rodman. I'm on the court playing. The court is made of finished white pine. It is very slippery. My shoes are slick, hard plastic or rubber. I spit on the soles to give them traction. My legs are stiff and sore: I'm rusty and very stiff. The ball is passed in. A teammate and I nearly turn it over, almost passing it out of bounds, but we save it. The other team fails to get back on defense and we get a two-on-one fast break. I'm one of the two, and I go in for the lay-up. I'm fouled. After the foul, as I fall, I grab the player who fouled me and drag him down with me. The referee calls an intentional foul on me. I know I'm guilty of this. I think it was my rustiness that made me commit the foul. I should have just realized I couldn't get away with it, and should have taken the foul and got the free throws. I am replaced in the game. Somehow, I get a shot, a lay-up that is an ally-oop, and is very out of control. It misses narrowly. Then I'm replaced. I walk off the court. I grab a tray of ground beef like one would buy at the grocery store, and dump it over the head of the other coach. I realize I'm in a dream. I fly, low to the court. I slide on my stomach on the court. The court is white plastic with meat blood on it, like a tray from the grocery store without the meat on it. I remember to look for the black and white cat from the Coverton neighborhood."

Something happens with gang-related violence, and instructions for being beaten up. One is to go by a pillar and yell out loud to get someone in specific to see you.

Instead I shoot him several times in the chest. It seems to be make-believe shooting: lines of orange-yellow pellets come out of the gun. He is not dead or injured. He chases me with a knife. We fight. I hit him with my gun. At one point I think I should just let him kill me because I will not die. He didn't die when I shot him, so I'll be fine."

        "dream_content": "Respectable ProstitutionI'm with Ben and Jill Gallon. Later it seems I'm with Jill and Grandma Redding. There is talk and jokes about sexual things. There is a sexual act occurring nearby. I'm tempted to get involved in it. I get an erection, outside a small shed, by myself. My next move would then be to confront the older women about fellatio and their denture-less mouths, or to go wherever this sexual act is occurring. Something happens with my flipping over two empty glasses, upside down. They're like the glasses Rob McDyss has given me to pour my beer into. I'm in a house where people have sex for money. It's more respectable than prostitution, which it is not. One can have sex anywhere on the body, within limits. People are employed to have sex and to allow others to have sex with them. I have sex with a large man. He is big and strong: hefty. He has dark skin and hair, like a traditional Maori. I think he's from the pacific islands. I don't know how it begins. I find him kneeling or bending over in front of me. My erection fumbles around, and then penetrates his anus, which feels tight and pleasurable. While we're having sex I ask what the instructions for orgasm are. They are: one is to stand up when they are about to orgasm and put their hands in the air (like they are being held up!). I do this, but not when I'm about to ejaculate: it's a trial experience for me. I leave before ejaculation. The man says something about the position of my hands above or below something, and how that alters the procedure for orgasm. When I stand up I'm naked, but am wearing my navy green t-shirt. I leave feeling guilty that I used these people because I didn't orgasm: I wasted their time. I walk into a kitchen where my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are. They're both naked, wearing towels around their waists. Both have erections. I walk up to them in my shirt, with an erection. This is a type of camaraderie: male bonding. There is nothing sexual about it, it seems."

I have my luggage with me, and am going home. I realize that I don't remember the flights to Los Angeles and to Metropolis. I can't remember traveling to get back home, even though I'm about to arrive. I ask several young boys on the bus where we are and how long we've been driving. They don't seem to know. I touch my surroundings to see if they are real: there are considerable inconsistencies that cause me to question my state of consciousness. I do not detect anything physically unusual. At one point I think I point at a car to see the energy in it, as Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda, but I see nothing usual about the car.I'm with my brother Wally and another man. I seem to be sleeping and dreaming, and then awake, drifting between sleep and wakefulness. I am on the verge of lucidity, and I try not to wake up; I try to maintain my lucidity in the dream (the dream within this dream). I test the reality of the situation by biting something and pounding/punching the floor to see if my hand/arm goes through. The floor is hard, and I conclude I'm not dreaming. I try to will my arm to go through the floor, moving it slowly, steadily, and firmly, but I can't pass it through the floor. I then awaken and find myself with the two men, who are laughing at me. I've been biting onto the toe of one of their shoes and pounding the floor with my fist. I think that those actions are incompatible with the atonia of REM, but I think that my body twitches in REM somehow caused this action or was the action. I'm outside on the front lawn at home in Oak Valley on the north side of the steps near the light. I try to write down the dream of the pounding and biting on the grass using a pen. I don't write the dream down completely, or clearly. It's hard to write on grass and rock/concrete. There is a group of women around, including my high school classmate Marybeth Neumann and others. They talk about dreams. I experience a dream[within this dream I'm now writing]in which there is a question of reality and dreaming: A dream within a dream within a dream."

The runway is narrow and curves. I'm afraid the wings may hit trees or other objects as we land and slow on the runway. The stewardess is going to make lunch, cooking a ham and a chocolate cake, during a short stop that we have. I take, and eat, a ham sandwich. The stewardess tells me that because I stole the sandwich I have to go without lunch. I lie, and tell her it was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I made myself, and she then says it's okay that I have lunch. I get off the plane with my former flat mate Glen Ryan. We wait near a swing set for the stewardess to cook the ham and cake. The plane takes off and lands two or three times, low and fast.

I recognize her face, and seem to know some about her. There is a brunette woman there. The conversation comes around to venereal diseases, and how people get them. The blond woman talks as if she knows about these diseases and how one gets them. The meal draws to a close and the brunette woman gets up to leave, nonchalantly urging her friend, who is another brunette, to leave as well. She does this to leave the blond woman and I alone, to try to get us together as a couple. I sit with the blond woman in a nervous, uncomfortable silence. I'm not aggressive: I don't try to kiss her. There's a moment when I look at her and have the opportunity to do so when it would be okay, but I don't. I act shy. It seems to me that she wants to have a sexual encounter. I know she smokes, and I take this into consideration when thinking of kissing of having a sexual encounter with her. It seems I'm walking near a fence line not far from the table when I think this. I'm alone. It's drizzling outside and I'm wearing my heavy yellow raincoat. I meet my old school classmate Rita Bauer and another woman from our high school who have just arrived back from a study abroad experience. I talk with them. Rita and I comment on the cold, rainy weather. We both think it's cold, and we're dressed for it. It seems many of the other people don't think so, and are not dressed for cold.

A man next to me gets his mail by reaching through an opening behind the mailboxes and pulling out his mail from the opening in the back. I manage to get my box open slightly and slip my mail out. I have a big stack of mail: about ten letters. Some are business, some personal. I see a letter that looks like it has my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' handwriting on the envelope, but I don't think it's from her, rather, from another woman with similar handwriting. I walk back from the post office down the hallway. There are stairs in the hallway, and people are stopping and sitting down all around the steps to read their mail."

I watch as he falls and am afraid he'll land on the bridge: splat! But he blows over it. He gets close to the water. I see white water below him, and am worried he's going to land in a shallow, rocky area and be killed. He lands, and I see him surface, alive and well. Others also jump. I don't jump because it's too high: I'm very scared of jumping from this height. We're in the river water below. There are many people swimming and floating, playing in the water. I see one body in the water, face down. I think the person is drowning, and pull their head up feeling panicked. The woman turns her head and moves so I know that she's okay. I'm nervous about this whole situation: very high jumping, people swimming about. I think someone may get hurt, and that concerns me. Four men in their late 20's, beer-drinkin', cigarette smokin', cut-off wearin', long stringy-haired guys, jump off the lower train bridge into the water. They joke, are careless, carefree, and silly.

I've lost track of the numerous airplane flights. I walk down the ramp. Some people go to the left to get luggage. That isn't the correct way to go; I go to the right. There are many luggage carousels. I don't know which will have my luggage on it. Some carousels are labeled with names. I walk to one that I think is correct because I vaguely recognize the people around it as being on the same flight as I. The luggage starts to feed out onto the carousel. I stand on the flat side and wait. A very large piece of cream-colored luggage appears. A young man runs after it and grabs it as it approaches me from my left. It's a very big, heavy bag, and appears to be hard-sided. As he grabs it, its slow but steady momentum makes him lunge forward, jerking his body. He manages to jerk and drag it off the carousel, and I see that it's not hard-sided, but is made of flimsy black cloth. The man starts to swear because there is a cello in the bag, and it was bumped when he removed it from the carousel. The carousel area is in the bush. There are sparse trees and pale green tall grasses around, dry looking scrub brush. I see a cellular phone on the carousel as it goes past me. I go after the phone because I know it's a man's phone: he is there but just missed it. I go to grab it and give it to him. I pick up the phone and am going to toss it to him but I don't: I'll walk it over to him. All the lighting in the area turns off: the area is dark. A dull, dim, but noticeable light is cast around and upon me. I feel on the spot: uneasy having a light shined on me in the dark. I may go to give the phone to its owner. I think I may have hit a button by accident when picking it up. The light on me changes its intensity. I walk with my grade school classmate Patrick Bergman. It's dark. We have some fleeting light at times to view what is in front of us. I see tan-colored mud, bubbling and boiling, giving off steam. We sidestep or trek lightly through this. We arrive at an entrance-like area where several young adults are. My friend Holly Lapson is there with two others, one of whom is a woman I recognize from school. They're at the entrance to act as greeters. We talk a bit. I am uneasy because of my past behavior around them: I've always been fairly antisocial in appearance and demeanor. Holly says there are two groups, one of which is going out tonight to do an activity. She reads the names of three or four people who are in this evening group. Then she tells me I'm with the morning group. She points out several small cabin-like shacks that are our lodgings. I know that this is a camp-like organization where meetings of young adults take place, in groups. I'm then in a crowd of people in the camp. I see many people I know, including my friend Emerald Reinhold, who waves and smiles at me. She's wearing gray with a hint of bright orange on a zipper; it may be fleece. Holly is there. I walk by my high school classmates Daryl and Chris Yeller. One of them walks on each side of me. I say hi. I see my high school classmates Kristy Puffy and Amber Sherman. My friend Jill Banks is there. I think Jill is back from Africa. I see two Jill Banks', who look exactly alike. There is a girl there who seems to be Jill's younger sister. I sit by myself as people walk and talk to each other. The atmosphere is friendly and happy. A younger blond man comes up to me. I vaguely recognize him as a basketball player, which is how he knows me. He says something like, \"Hey Hanson, how's it going?\" I respond lukewarmly, say, \"Okay.\" I talk with Kristy. I'm losing awareness because I've been traveling so long. I ask her where we are because I honestly have no idea. She says we're at the Duck's call, which is the name of the camp. I ask where it is, and she says Blackville. I ask where that is, and she says Rwanda! I recognize the name of Rwanda to be in Africa. I ask if we're in Africa and she says yes. Wow. I can't believe I'm in Africa. This is an orientation outing, to get to know people. I think this is a really long way to have flown for orientation."

I grab a stick that is partially fallen and drag it along for a bit. We near the park and I see that people are setting up for the bazaar. There is a huge army green canvas tarp that is being set up and staked down to be a trampoline. The Blackstone family is helping with the setup. Their little girl is crying. I stop and note her crying. I feel guilty because when I was a child I treated these people badly. I'm down under the park pavilion. Many people are there: familiar faces.

I want to talk to them, but would prefer them to come to greet me, rather than I greeting them. Jill runs around the crowd over to me and we share a big hug. I pick her up, my arms locking down near her waist or butt. She is very light. We talk a bit. I tell her that last night I had a dream that I saw two of her that were exactly the same! She has a friend with her who is a tall woman with shoulder length straight blond hair. She has a small stud nose ring in her left nostril. She is very attractive, I think. She may be wearing a black blazer and seems to have an orange (the fruit) on her somewhere, or an orange is associated with her. She may have a piece of orange peel stuck to her face somewhere, which then falls off. I stand with them and talk. I'm wearing my maroon Nike shorts and my Redson 9th grade basketball t-shirt. Jill's friend comments on my hairiness; I see she sees my legs. I take this as a compliment: I like my hairiness. But I act standoffish, as if I don't know how to take her comment, saying, \"Uhhhhh, Okay.\" As we talk, my high school crush Harmony Allure and her friend walk by, and catch my eye. They act as though they don't see me, and I don't acknowledge them. The pavilion is going to be used for Bingo. The announcer rhymes haphazardly on the microphone in a comical manner. His words don't quite rhyme, but he manipulates them in a humorous manner. The crowd and I laugh. I see that the announcer is Jake Truck. Jake has a black and gray beard. I'm jealous of the attention and affection that he gets in this role as announcer. I try to dismiss this feeling. There is an announcement for those in back to sit down, so all the people can see and the game can begin. I go and sit on the edge of a large black picnic table. I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel carrying a baby. As people all crowd in to find a place to sit I slide down to the end of the bench. My friend Nate Nelling is at the other end. He yells at me saying, \"Hanson, don't move down!\" He doesn't want me to give up my space to these latecomers that are now crowding in. I see that Grandpa Redding is sitting in the middle of the bench, a few people down from me."

The fish turns and swims past me on my left side. There is a band behind me. The fish swims towards it, there is no water there. I see the fish is then an animal with four legs, each about two feet long. It is wrapped in blue plastic wrap and has a rubber band around part of it. I pick it up by its hind legs. I'm afraid of it biting or scratching me. I swing it, whacking it against a large sink six or nine times. It's now dead. After this incident where I beat the animal to death a sketchy evening news team pursues me because of my behavior. A woman with a microphone hounds me. I don't reply.

I see a man swimming off to my left. He returns to the shore where I am. He sees me. We begin to talk, slowly and cautiously. He is my old boss Mike Hollow. I wonder if I'm dreaming, but I don't question the reality of the situation because I think it may be offensive to him. I don't want to annoy or anger him. I tell him that I'm sorry for leaving and explain what I was thinking when I left. He says he's in a hurry and starts to leave, but our conversation continues. I tell him what I have to say about respect: my viewpoint then and now. I try to make amends. I tell him if he ever needs help I'd like to work for Fishing Haven again. He says maybe. He tells me last Christmas was bad."

It touches down at about midpoint of the runway, which I late, I think. It slows down, but is still going fast, approaching the end of the runway and a fence. It turns sharply to its left, going past us, narrowly avoiding the fence and us. It's a small three-person place. Planes take off to our left. They speed down the runway. I don't know if they will lift off enough to fly over the hills at the end of the runway. One of the planes lifts off and flies up in a loop-de-loop. It's a silver hot rod van with a trailer. There are other cars too that fly up in loops. They are very powerful, can fly straight upwards. I think and feel the difficulty of pulling or straightening out of a car after flying right loop-de-loops in succession."

I somehow hurt John's feelings, am rude to him. He leaves feeling dejected and angry. I'm holding a barbell and John and Simon are holding the ends. I don't want them to do this, it annoys me. I shake the bar, jerking one end and then the other, freeing it from their grips. Simon lets go, and seems apologetic. As I jerk the bar, the right end hits the large mirror that is behind us, and leaves cracks that look like a spider web. I feel bad: I'm guilty. No one with authority is there, so I play it off as if it never happened, like I'm not responsible for the cracks. I use the barbell with two 25-pound plates on it. I try to military press the bar, standing up. I can't do it, trying several times, struggling, and failing to fully extend my arms above my head. I am alone in the corner of the weight room. I look out the windows and see trees. It seems to be the area near High and Old Avenues in Woodland, next to the river. There is a phone call for a person named Katie, from a woman. The woman is calling about a talk show. The woman works 2am-2pm, and says Katie should call her back after these hours. I see the broken glass is one small pane, of many, which comprise the large mirror. The pane is about 8\" x 10\", and is flexible. It has a magnet on the back to stick to the background. I think it may not be too expensive to replace. I'm on the curb of the south lane of Old Avenue near the river. I see a woman on the road in front of me. She's wearing an orangish-brownish-goldish bikini. She has huge breasts: at least an F or G cup. I say to her, \"You have huge tits!\" I grab her, move her to the ground, and say, \"Let's fuck.\" We start to have a sexual encounter and I rub my penis between her breasts. She has had breast implants. There are two large, lumpy areas on her breasts that are purple or black in color. I slide my erection between her breasts and tell her to give me fellatio at the same time. She does. I near orgasm, and feel pre-ejaculatory fluid spurt out of my erection. She stops giving me fellatio: she doesn't want a mouthful of semen. I say, \"No! Keep sucking!\", and I start to masturbate to keep up the arousal. She starts to give me fellatio again. I'm very aroused and am experiencing much pleasure, very close to orgasm."

This is scary, because I'm not sure what this man will do: what he does or wants. I think even though he's in the driver's seat he probably won't know how to operate the truck. He's slim, with long scraggly brown hair, not greasy or stringy, but soft and slightly curled. It's not combed, but looks okay. He's wearing a rusty red or brown mechanic's suit. He has a mysterious quality about him. I determine to not prejudge him. I ask him his name. He tells me. Police officers come up behind us. A female officer sternly says, \"Get out of the car. Don't say or do anything. Not a word, or I'll arrest you.\" We silently get out. The man mocks the officer, whining and mumbling intentionally. She begins to arrest him. There is a male officer on my side of the truck when I get out. He is about 5'10\", with a round head. He speaks to the female officer, saying, \"Why don't we let these guys go?\" She agrees.

My shotgun doesn't work well for me. I misfire a lot, and have the safety on when I want it off. I'm having difficulty firing when I want to. I fiddle with the gun, trying to get it to work. A large flock of Canada geese is well within range right in front of me. My friend Kevin Simpson comes up next to me; we take aim. There are geese tightly packed on the water, and it seems more geese are on top of these, up to several feet off the water. The geese scatter. I misfire. I try to fire again at a goose that is close, just as it's taking off. It slows and sinks into the water. I happy, I finally shot a goose! It begins to float. I grab its head of black hair and lift it out of the water. It's not a goose, but a boy! He is hit in three or four places with pellets: in the head and upper body, and won't live. I'm horrified! I have shot a person! I try to comfort the dying boy, give him what I can. I caress his limbs and hold him in my arms. I try to keep him warm, hugging him. The boy is wearing shorts.

The street in front of the house looks like it's under construction from the tornado damage. The trees in the yard have been bent and broken. The color of the bark of the branches is lighter.

Much of the damage is subtle: no walls or windows are broken, but the structure and foundation seem to be less stable. I shine a few lights on my room, which is on the east side, upstairs. There are unscathed liquor bottles. The floor is flexible. I think that it needs a good solid layer of plywood to lend some strength to it. My mom tells me that the cause of this destruction is a person: someone left her a note, threatening her because of something she has begun. I think this is atrocious. I fully support my mom in her cause even though I don't have personal interest in it. I know there has been arson: a fire.

There is a building on the northeast corner of the intersection of Gallop Avenue and 3rd Street. In the windows are large copper colored pictures of old pennies. This is a campaign strategy: to get old buffalo or Indian images on the penny reinstated at the mint. I'm driving south to my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I seem to be in an alley. I stop when I near his house. I'm in back of his house, which faces west on the west side of the block. It's early morning. I was at his house yesterday, but am back for something. There are stacks of newspapers outside on the ground. Kevin delivers papers. There are stacks of large envelopes that have been sent via Federal Express to his door. The house is a single story with a basement and no deck. I have a key to the door. The door is solid gray and whitish with no windows. It is unlocked. I go in and yell hello. I don't expect Kevin to be here. I'm in the basement. Kevin's cat is there, and I call it to me. Urine from the cat starts to drip and stream from the ceiling. Kevin is then there. He yells at the cat, which stops it from urinating and scares it off. I realize he has a partner upstairs in bed. I ask him, and he tells me he doesn't know who she is or where she came from: a one-night stand. I realize that the person we're speaking of is male."

        "dream_content": "A Potentially Round TableI'm with my mom, brother Wally, and sisters Heather and Ramona in Sydney, Australia. We're on a small white tour boat. I look at a map that has a number of very colorful buildings on it. They're red and yellow, and made into odd shapes like amusement rides. The buildings are very bright. I see them: see the area to which the map corresponds. They line a shore a ways off in the harbor. The boat docks and the captain immediately starts taking tickets for the next tour. There are two grayish-white dogs on board. One dog has a bandana on, like a ribbon, to indicate that she is a female dog. We get off the boat and walk up a street to a restaurant. The area is older and has some brick. It's not dirty or uncared for, but is plain, quaint, and old. We walk. There are a few people walking near us, maybe going to the same place. We may pick up our pace to beat them to the place. The restaurant is on the left side of the road. We enter. I know the restaurant is about to close, and the bar will be open. I'm at a table with Wally in a small square room. There are short hallways into adjacent rooms where there are tables at which people are dining. We make commotion, tripping, kicking, or knocking things over. The people in one of the next rooms, behind me, seem to be upper class, \"proper and decent\" folks. They are annoyed by the ruckus we have caused, disturbing their meal. I think of closing the doors to the room so we won't disturb them. The table we're situated at seems to be quite open, in a well-traveled area of the restaurant. It is square, and made of dark smooth hardwood. It has a leaf on each side that flips up, creating a round table. I say to Wally that while the square table will accommodate four people nicely, since we have five people we should flip up the leaves to accommodate us all more comfortably. He doesn't seem keen on this idea. I think it's an easy decision for the comfort, practicality, and convenience of us all. I'm in an adjacent room. All the rooms have been decorated with tact and taste, and are neat and quaint, though others might describe them as elegant. There is a sort of mixer occurring: some event where people are socializing. A familiar face and voice catch my eye: my high school teammate Simon Naver! I stand up and turn around in surprise, asking myself if I'm dreaming. Simon is smiling and happy, and greets me energetically. I ask him in disbelief what the hell he's doing here. He replies that he's here because something happened to our old teammate Larry Rollie. Larry was supposed to be here to receive an award or honor, or was named to a special project or assignment in the community. Simon is here on Larry's behalf."

There are physically strong and aggressive people involved in the conflict. I leave. I walk out of the room, picking up my ex-girlfriend Annie and carrying her out. We walk down a large hallway, like Scott Junior High, seemingly going west down the north hallway. I lift her up, and she sits on my shoulders. I have trouble balancing with her until she locks her feet behind my back. I walk down the hallway, crouching as we go below arches in the ceiling: low spots, so she doesn't hit her head. We near the end of the hallway and come to a large open room on our right. She tells me she thinks this is where she has to take a written test. I see many writing at desks, seemingly taking a test. People are waiting. I have a test to take as well: a different kind of test. It seems that Annie's test is more academically challenging. I think that this is appropriate because she is a keener scholar than I. Before I leave to go to my area, which is somewhere else, to test, she tells me that I had better call her, to stay in touch, or she'll track me down. She is serious. I feel good about myself because She cares about me, and I know I'll stay in touch with her. I don't know the room I'm testing in: I didn't make a point of remembering the room number. There's no time now to go back and look at the sheet that says the room numbers.I'm in a wooded area comprised of a few large trees and lots of undergrowth and brush. There is a packed dirt path, curving very gently through the vegetation. There are many pothole-like depressions in the path where rainwater has collected producing large puddles that forces one to skirt the edges of the path. I come to an opening where the forest clears. There is a huge fallen tree with a sign or metal plate on it indicating its age as about 1800 years (1836?)."

She doubts the authority of the man I spoke with while trying to determine exactly who it was. She wonders if the person I spoke with was female. I say no, he was male. We talk about work, and I tell her I'd be more than willing to work a day or two at this deli. I tell her to just call me for problems or questions. I walk away with a red plastic sled that has a pointed tip, in my hand. We walk in this mall-like area. A food court is on our left. There is a place that sells fresh fish, advertising Walleye, Northern Pike, and more. I think, who would want to eat northern pike?

I return shortly, to more adequately prepare myself for the walk. It's a very cold, clear day. I estimate it's close to 0 degrees Fahrenheit. I start to pull on a few layers of clothing. I put on polypropylene bottoms, my gray wool socks with the red stripe, and my old Vasque hiking boots. I may put another layer on my legs. I wear a new red mountaineering parka that my brother Wally has just bought for me. I have me green wool hat and my black and maroon gloves. On my back is my backpack containing my yak's wool sweater. I have a pink hip pouch that I fasten around my waist. I'm inside. My friend Reed Maxwell is there. I toss him a pair of white and red striped polypropylene bottoms. Our friend Fiona Ulness is there. She tells me I look like a guy that is pictured on a milk jug. I look at some jugs, but do not see or agree with her. Our classmates Grace Hanley and Jill Foster are there. I walk outside. There is frost on everything. I seem to be on the southeast end of the lake. I need to walk north, then west, to the summit. My jacket is fully zipped and secured. I feel good: strong, prepared, and ready to go. Reed is next to me. I find I have a beer in my waist pouch. Reed takes a gulp of it. A woman yells at us for having beer. Reed pours it out of the clear glass bottle onto the ground. I put the empty bottle back in my pouch where there is another full beer bottle. A large group of kids walks towards us from out right, down by the lake. They're leaving the area, and herd by us. I walk, and others follow me. We go through a forest with tall trees and little undergrowth. There are two forest service men chopping wood in the crisp air. They're fully dressed for the cold. As I pass them on their right one of them says to me in a storm trooper-like voice, \"Fan out.\" I obey his direction and branch off the path to my left. He tells the others as they approach and they fan out as well. We reach an area that is a new track, all laid out. Two by fours bound it on each side, with fill in the middle. We're instructed to trample over the new portions of the track to pack them down. We do. We trample through rice, which quickly spreads from our feet to outside the bounded track. We also walk through mud. My friend Norman Noman and classmate Geoff Hamilton are among the group. I'm then in a group of people where a contest is occurring. There are some big, strong, powerful men there. It's possible that one could get hurt or killed. One of the big men seems to falter at his opportunity: he could, but doesn't throw a spear or dart a long distance. A man blows a dart at me. The contest involved direct physical impacts between two people. There is a large man with a mask. I get shot at twice from close range. Both four-inch darts pierce the skin of my chest, slightly to the right of my sternum. They do not penetrate farther, and I feel no pain. I laugh at the event. My body seems to be very, very strong, like it is impenetrable. It is then my turn. There is a bald man there, wearing a hooded cloak. I go easy on him, not really knowing or thinking of any good feats of punishments to impose on him. I spit a mouthful of a slurpee drink through a straw onto his head. He is like Spock from Star Trek. This is a silly and insignificant feat. It is embarrassing more to me for it's lack of aggression, but I don't want to really hurt the man."

She comes back in a moment and gives me more money because she calculated my change wrong, and she's correcting her error. When she does, she gives me too much back. There is a supervisor-like woman there. I tell them to take about 60 cents away from my change. There is a large rose bush there. Its branches are thinly spaced. It is in bloom, and has pink blossoms. My friend Melanie McDyss and her sister Beth are there. We talk. The three of us are in a bed. I'm afraid they'll realize I'm attracted to them, so I play it cool. We're sitting at a table with others. There is a poem on the wall about Beth's adventures, particularly with men. She has been pretty wild. She goes and defecates in the bushes, and gives men her pubic hair. Melanie and I hug each other.

The camera clicks a flash photograph, pointing directly at me. I quickly cover my face, but it's too late. They succeed in hitting the camera. We invade the building. The small store contains mostly fruit. One of the men is from North Dakota. He grabs a brown rye. It's stringy, like the outside of a coconut. He takes a few bits, then gives it to me. I take bites. It's sweet and good. We hurry through the store, taking two or three fruits. I think it's dumb to take just a little bit: not worth the risk of entering. We run into the back loading area and I see metal doors, like a garbage disposal or a loading ramp. I push an object away from the doors that is outside the building against the doors. We access the outside. It's a semi truck that I pushed. We jump out, having escaped. It doesn't look like we're being followed, but it's difficult to tell. We go down a dark alley away from the store. I'm worried we're being pursued. I walk faster, leaving them behind. On my right I see the backside of three houses with lights on.

We're under a car bridge next to a river with gravely, rocky, granite banks. Everyone has his or her hand of cards. I'm across a small channel, about 12 feet wide, from the others. I play a card, flicking it across the channel like a Frisbee. I ask if the cards are wax coated, because the card lands in the water next to the bank. They are wax coated. We play the game. I have no clubs, a good diamond and hearts hand, and four spades, some of which are high. I play cards, not realizing at first that hearts are trump. I try to bring out the joker because I know that some of the others are short-suited in red and I want my face cards to be good for tricks.

The man says, matter-of-factly, that they can't change that now: they've already signed up. I think the jump is a crazy feat that I wouldn't do. I see a photograph of a long backpack. It's a \"full mountain pack\" and is designed to fit a person inside it. I walk a short ways and am on a rock or cliff. There are two people with me. Their intent is to jump off the cliff, for fun. The rock ledge we're on slopes downwards gradually, then increasingly, and then is a sheer rock face. It's such that one may be able to peer over the edge for a look. I start to peer over. I'm very afraid of the height. I get down flat on my stomach and crawl towards the edge. It's too steep for me, so I'm going down headfirst just to peer over. I turn around because going headfirst is too frightening. I slide on the rock, not having a good grip. I say to the others, \"I'm sliding!\" They are unconcerned and say that I'm not really sliding. The man decides to jump. He says that he's jumping. He trots past me wearing shorts and tall black cowboy-like boots with no socks. He may have a funny hat on as well. He runs awkwardly with his knees high and legs out, like a comedian. He goes at a steady pace, a bit faster than a jog, and doesn't pause when he reaches the edge, hopping off. He drops below the line of visibility and I see only rocks. The cliff is very high, about 200 feet. I'm not even considering the jump: I think it is disastrous for me. At one point I see a person with a black backpack or parachute on. It doesn't look very sturdy. It's connected in front of the torso by two rings that are four or five inches in diameter. I'm in a dark room. There are photographs of two people on the floor. They may be landing sites of the jumps. In one of the photos is my acquaintance Heather Salley."

I see two nickels in a slot machine coin tray. I drop them in the five-card draw poker machine. I go for it all, holding an eight and ten of hearts. I draw three eights. My four eights pays 46,000 nickels. In order to cash out I must first put down one ace, which means to choose a red or black ace. The ace is for approval, it seems. It makes no difference on the payout, but has to occur. I do this, and want to cash out. The hopper on the machine, which I know as the kicker, is empty. A man from the casino comes around and I try to get him to help me with my payout. He won't help or pay me. He says I was in the group of three guys who were loud or had caused trouble earlier. I argue honestly that I wasn't part of that. He still won't cooperate, so I grab him by the t-shirt with both my fists and threaten to expose his unfair treatment of me by announcing the man's actions to all the people in the casino. He seems to change his mind, then. I have given him a time limit, and he returns in a minute with another man who starts to unlock the machine. This doesn't come to fruition. It takes too long, or the man doesn't pay me. I turn and yell to the people around me about the incident that has just occurred, and how the man discriminated and was unfair to me even though I wasn't in a bad group. A few people turn and look at me, listening. Their reaction is not strong. No one is rallying behind me. One woman asks about my statement. I explain to her what happened. Not only is she unsympathetic, but she also says I'm gay, like the three guys. I'm flustered and mad: none of us are gay! I leave out a door, crossing a road. I say to a woman that 'quite' is not a word that gay people characteristically say, but that people from Australia do. I say this to her as if she's dumb for not knowing it. I walk down concrete stairs around the edge of a building. There is a woman in front of me. I may walk too fast and step on her heels. I don't go around her, though the steps are wide enough to do so. I see my classmate Sara Henry, who looks a lot like my classmate Heather Beckers. She is in a gray car full of people. They seem to be going to school. I go inside the building. Two young men are painting the floor blue in places, using long dowel-like sticks with mop-like heads. I steal a stick, wrestling it away from a man. I run, trying to spread the blue paint all over the floor, or track it on the floor. I trip over some large pies that are red and blue in color, and try to spread them all over the floor. I come to a stairway that doubles back. Students of the play Grease are on the stage in a rehearsal. I run up the stairs, disrupting the rehearsal. I yell at and threaten the director and the actors and actresses.

Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there.I'm in court, which is a deli. Herald is on trial. My name is called to go to the witness stand. I'm surprised, and feel pressure. I'm sworn in. I put my right hand on a tub of hummus. I hold the tub with my thumb around the edge and my four fingers over the top. I try to keep my hand flat while holding it. The woman bailiff swears me in, asking me if I promise to tell the whole truth. I say, \"I do.\" As I'm sworn in, my right hand and arm falls down, it seems as if the bailiff isn't holding the bible (hummus) anymore. I quickly glance at the judge to see if this makes a difference. The judge doesn't flinch, so I guess it's okay. I'm then on the witness stand. It's about six feet square bounded by a one or two-foot high fence made of wood or wire. The judge is to my right, at about 2:00. There are some ovens and some deli cases to the right of the judge. The prosecuting lawyer is questioning me. He is a young blond man. He asks me the name of the deli manager. I say her name is Patty. I don't know her last name, I say. He asks me if I see her in the courtroom. I say no, she isn't here. He then asks me if the inspector is there, meaning the health inspector at Mountain Market. I stand up and look around the courtroom/deli. I really don't know who the inspector is. By process of elimination I come up with a few people in the room who could be the inspector, based upon where people are sitting and whom I know has some other role in the room. I point out one man, and say that could be him. He is wearing a gray sweater and has gray hair. He is a big person. I say I don't really know if he's here: when we work we all have different tasks, and I just haven't taken notice of who he is. The lawyer then asks me several vague and indirect questions. I don't know what he's trying to demonstrate: where he's going with his line of reasoning. I'm very direct with him. I say very firmly, \"Why don't you tell the court where you're going with this.\" He arrogantly says that he will. He then brings up my criminal history. I immediately feel threatened and think he may expose my speeding ticket or expired tab citation, or my stealing meat and cheese from the deli. He starts to talk about my life. He is speaking pure lies, trying to degrade my credibility. He says I missed bail three times. I realize that this guy is talking out of his ass: he doesn't have a clue about me. I yawn and stretch and scratch my head in contempt for him. I look around and see my friend Sam Kingsley and a woman who works at Mountain Market. By their facial expressions I know they know that the prosecutor is making it all up. The prosecutor rambles on without making a point. The people who know me know that what he is saying isn't true. My lawyer, who is Herald's lawyer, but seem seems like my lawyer or is on my side-because I seem to be on trial-is a woman with short straight dark hair. She is pretty. As I'm testifying a timer for the ovens go off. Patty, who is near the judge's bench, switches some food, maybe ribs, in the oven as the trial takes place."

        "dream_content": "Autofellatio 16I'm in a room with my brother Wally and two others. I'm masturbating, sitting on a toilet in the open. I use my left hand to stimulate my anus lightly while I masturbate. Pieces of feces come out of my anus. They are hard and crusty, some large and some small. I drop these pieces into the toilet. I think this is embarrassing and unusual that I'm masturbating in front of these people, but I don't concede the experience is any less real. It is also less disagreeable to me: some kind of social or mental compromise has been reached. Wally says there's no more lotion, which I had used to masturbate. I give myself fellatio by bending over. I'm not able to fit much of my erection in my mouth: just the tip. I decide I'll only give myself fellatio when I'm about to ejaculate. There is an area of the room where a shower curtain could be set up: there is a metal ring structure to which a gray shower curtain is attached. Wally comes over and helps me set up the curtain. There is a metal track-like structure attached to the ceiling, to which the curtain rings are attached. The curtain slides on this track. I'm wearing a pair of my button fly Levi jeans and white brief underwear, but my erection is exposed as we set up the curtain. I'm in the shower then, to have a private place to masturbate. There is almost no room between the shower curtain and the wall: no room to move, just to stand. I slide down to the floor, sitting, and lift the curtain over my head, putting it behind me. I unbutton my fly and continue to masturbate: I just want to ejaculate. Others see me, and I feel embarrassed, but I just want to orgasm. I give myself fellatio and semen comes out of my erection. It's very salty, and I spit it out onto a while athletic sock that I have. I don't have the physical sensation of orgasm, though I did suck some semen out, so I continue to masturbate to have an orgasm."

We talk about North Dakota tourists. I tell the people that the place to go is three miles in one direction. We cross a dirt road where there is fast-driving traffic, and walk down the road. We're in a car. There are six people in it. My friend Paul Jones is driving. We're riding to school. He drives fast; the shoulder of the road is bumpy. I sit in back on the right. I try to fasten my safety belt but the chest strap for it is broken. Paul asks us to close the windows to help clean or defrost them. I think it's already stuffy in the car, and say it will take ten or 15 minutes to air out and clean the windows whether they're open or closed. There is a new boat for sale. There are men in dresses who appear, something happens as a joke. We approach Tressel. I go inside when we stop at a gas station. I see a manual camera for $9.08. I stop to look at it, and am very interested in buying it. The man who runs the station comes over to me. He is my acquaintance Jackie's father. He talks about Jackie, and asks me if I know her. I say yes: She was in Australia when I was, and I lived near her Salt Lake City. He makes a comment on how we better watch out now that we're back in Tressel, implying changes in her relationships with men. He may think I'm one of her old boyfriends."

We're like Carlos Casteneda and Juan Matos. We're near the ceiling. There may be some kind of a cylindrical structure there, possibly accompanying the teaching. I stand on something, which may be the white five-gallon plastic buckets, with covers, from Mountain Market, to get closer to him, in a final effort to understand his teachings. It is his time to go: to die or leave. Then, he is gone. I must follow him. I feel I must pursue him-not so much his physical body, but the whole person of him, and what he meant in my life. I lay in bed on my back. My right leg is bent at the knee, upwards. My left leg crosses my right leg: my left ankle resting on my right knee. I intend to will myself to go where this man is. I concentrate intensely, focusing all my energy. In some respects, I don't know what I'm doing, but I seem to have some sort of direction or knowledge that guides or directs me: an innate sense. I concentrate on moving. My body lifts up. I lean upwards and forwards. I see a pale image of my body separate from my physical body, which has not moved from the cross-legged position on the bed. My knees are a bit sore, and I think of the amount of time my physical body will be immobile: it will be uncomfortable to keep my knees still, but I disregard this. I continue to concentrate as my \"soul\" body separates from my physical body. I'm slightly surprised and amazed at what is happening, but am determined to continue the experience. I lift up out of my physical body on the bed. I stand, shakily. It's difficult to move. I'm a fledgling, a newborn: uncoordinated and weak. I steady myself and begin to walk, with increasing coordination. Then I realize I don't need to walk: I fly. I'm in an apartment. I fly through a doorway around the apartment, looking around. It is very neat. The walls are pink or coral in color. There is neat, modest furniture, very conservatively decorated. I want to see the man, because I know this is his realm. I will him to appear in one of two chairs with a small coffee-like table in between them. He does not appear. I realize that he is the apartment: that everything around me consists of him."

I swing down on the dock, below it, holding onto the wood, and drop into the water, swimming the short distance to where the dock continues. We walk on, Kevin is next to me. We move quickly and deftly. There are grates on our path that close in front of us as we approach them. Kevin slides under some of these. I slow down: I'm not up for sliding under closing doors. The doors open up, they are like automatic garage doors. I grab some of them as they close, lifting them up, opening them. My fingers get pinched between the door and the ground.

There are some uniquely designed old cars there. I'm inside the mall and my dad is there. He is very terse with me, giving me a $20 bill and an umbrella. I'm standing outside a video game store that is in the approximate location of Musicland. Inside the store boys are playing Pacman and skiing on a computer. People disperse, and I have my chance to play. I'm about to play, when I decide that I want my day at the mall to be productive, so I continue on. An employee from one of the mall stores walks up to another person or group near me. Someone gets man at the man approaching because he has been dripping soda in a trail behind him. I go into Smith's Sports through the entrance by Subway. I'm looking for #6 size fishing hooks with barbs. The hooks I see are flimsy: they're just prickly metal wires.

We run though a ship on narrow walkways, turn sharp corners, and jump over blocks. The area seems to be made of grayish-white concrete. Three pirates are chasing us. I run past weapons that are on the ground: knives of different types. I'm a good distance ahead of the pirates, and in no need of a weapon. I'll leave them for Kevin. I may pick up a weapon later. I feel very confident in my ability to evade the pirates: I'm nimble, quick, and decisive. There is a confrontation, a battle between Kevin and I, and the three pirates. We have knives. We seem to be the \"good guys\". We spar. I may be stabbed or cut, but I feel no pain and notice no difference in my ability to duel. We are victorious, but it really seems like there is no big winner: it is just a duel. The play is over. I'm in a crowd of people. A group of people around me all have red or reddish hair. I feel that they are looking at me funny, as if they don't like me or have some interest in my and my actions. Most of them are not tall. I notice some of the women are attractive. Some of the red-haired people approach me and tell me I have nice skin, or skin like in a movie. I'm surprised by this comment. They're not talking about any part of my body's skin in particular, but I perceive the focus to be on my upper body. I'm outside. I'm running to the student union building at Brimson. I slow down and walk. I see my acquaintance Jim Henry going in the opposite direction of me, calling out his girlfriend's name: \"Jackie!\" I see him and jokingly call out, \"Jackie!\" I pass a young woman while I walk. She was in my Brain, Mind, and Behavior class. She has blond hair, prominent white teeth, and sat in the front of the room near the window. I near a building that has many large windows. Inside I see my friend Melanie McDyss waiting to make a phone call. I go into to see her because we haven't seen each other since we left for study abroad. I pick her up and we share a big hug. I'm very energetic. We fall on the ground, I'm still hugging her, very happy to see her. The hug ends abruptly. She seems to be taken back because of my energeticness. I feel out of place for giving her such a friendly, energetic greeting, because it appears to me that it was more than she expected and desired. We sit there, at a loss for words, feeling awkward. The conversation is dying and dull. Melanie's friend Erica Lange is then with us. We're sitting together, facing each other. They tell me that there are a lot of things I won't be able to do. I don't understand them fully, but from their tones I know they are reprimanding me for something I've done that they deem inappropriate. I think I must have done something wrong: offended or insulted someone, and now they are mad at me. I have no knowledge of what this could be. I feel uncomfortable, and get up abruptly and leave, saying a terse, \"Bye.\" I walk to Armstrong High School, which is not too far away. I enter with no problem: I am asked no questions. I see some people I know, including my old classmate Larry Erickson. Then I see my friend Bubba Hacker. Bubba's first comment to me is something like, \"Oh, there's the guy...\" to the effect that he and everyone else know what it is I've done that is so radical and bad. This disgusts me. How can everyone know what I've done, and yet I am oblivious to it, I wonder. I'm frustrated, angry, and confused. I just want to know what it is. I say I'm going to defecate, and turn into the bathroom near the freshmen lockers. Bubba also enters to defecate. There are two stalls with no door on either. As we sit, we look out towards the sinks. The stalls are divided, but due to the mirror above the sinks we can see each other. I ask Bubba emphatically what is going on: why everyone but me seems to know what's going on with me. He replies something like, \"You know how ____ (a woman) is attracted to you? Are you attracted to her?\" I honestly reply no. Bubba says, \"Well, there you go\" indicating that my lack of attraction to women is my problem. I'm confused, and don't believe what he's saying: I don't think that is the problem. He gets up and washes his hands. I defecate a lot, and for a long time. The toilet bowl is metal. Toilet paper comes out of the inside of the toilet bowl on the right side, like out of a box of tissues. The toilet paper is brown and yellowish, in clusters, folded like a tray of sliced deli meat. It seems to have already been used. My feces are soft looking and yellowish."

My friend Nat Miller is there. My friend Stephen Ramos is in a smaller bed in the southwest corner of the room. His dog Spot is with him. Spot starts to bark and growl when the people come near him. I don't want these people (one woman and one or two men) to sleep just anywhere. I tell Nat he can sleep in my mom's room (she isn't here). Then I suggest the floor downstairs for the others, in an attempt to put some distance between them and I, so I still get a good night of sleep. One of the men suggests that he sleep in the bed with me. I don't like that idea: I would feel crowded.

Our fight is just a scuffle: no serious blows are delivered at first, but it continues. He is a short, slim man. He may be Mexican. I clutch the back of his head and smash his head and face into a wall. He falls down and lies on the ground. I see that his head is bleeding. This has an emotional impact on me: it is serious in comparison to our scuffle. There is just a small amount of blood, but it's significant: it frightens and startles. Me. There is a wood structure about two feet square made of layers of wood pressed together, a few inches thick. There's a head (of the man) smashed between some of these wood pieces. Bits and pieces of brain, skull, and blood drip and pour out of the wood structure. I try to figure out which way is 'up' on the structure so the blood and brains will remain in the fragmented portion of the skull and not drip out. It's of no use: every way I flip the structure blood still drips out. There is not much blood left in it. There are other people around. A grocery store is right next to where we are. I'm with several people. We all seem to be employees of the store. I will get off work in 20 minutes, at 9:30pm. I need to conceal this death, because it is scandalous. Some sort of plan materializes. It seems to be a group idea that I will have to implement myself. The body needs to be disposed of, and it needs to appear as if I entered the cab of the semi truck through the sun-roof-like opening. I'm in a bedroom that I know is mine. Many things are made of brown wood. There is a container of petroleum jelly on one of the beds. I think a man must have left it out there after masturbating. I grab one of the small flashlights I have. There are a couple batteries on the bed that look like size 'D', but are shorter and fatter. I climb up ladder-like stairs to the cab of the semi truck. The steps are made of wooden dowels, one inch in diameter and a foot long. I'm scared as I climb. I think someone may be in the cab waiting to harm me. I get up to the cab and see it's empty. There are a couple shelves with numerous items laid out very neatly on them. The shelves are the cab, essentially. There are wood cabinet doors around the shelves, like bars. I take several keys off a shelf. Some of the keys are gold, attached to gold key rings. Some keys are small, like our old square freezer key with a round tip. I have to use the keys to start and move the truck. I'm on the ground. There is a noise. It's a curious, strange noise that I find frightening. I dismiss and ignore it. I hear the noise again. Others look to see what it is. The noise seems to be coming from a pile of wood and metal scraps. Then its source is uncovered/exposed. It is something covered in black plastic. I know it's a person who is in sordid captivity, but is alive. I'm afraid of the person. I'm hesitant to get near the plastic, of getting involved in any way with the person or thing in the plastic, because I'm afraid it will harm me. Someone (me?) removes the plastic at one end, and we see it is a man. I'm afraid of him. He extends his arm, holding out a letter for me. I take them quickly. I'm involved in a situation that is greater than I: held and captivated by it. The letters may be from my sister Ramona. I'm scared of the letters. The writer, who is not Ramona, knows a lot about my life, and me and yet I'm unfamiliar with him. It seems there are instructions in the letters: things about me: my past, present, and future, and things that I have to do, from a source greater than I. I'm scared to read the letters.

I get into my mom's Chevy Celebrity; I'm driving. The car is very clean. I go to pick them up. We're in a casino that we've stopped at. I play a few quarters in a random slot machine. I talk to someone-maybe Wally- telling him about a woman who defaulted on her loans, and then won enough at the casino to make a payment of $8,000 towards the principle of her loan. As my slot machine spins I say it would be nice to win enough to pay a chunk of loans like that. I turn and look at the slot machine. Numbers stop spinning: 2, 0, 0... As they stop one by one, I imagine the best: the jackpot, of all zeros after the two. The numbers keep flipping, and are all zeros! I have won 10,000 quarters! I start to laugh! Wally is there. Bells on the machine go off. The machine has stopped at 171,000,000 coins. Wow, I think: I've won a lot. I call the attendant over. She asks me if I want a check. I say yes. I reconsider and ask the siblings if we should gamble more instead of going to the theatre. They say yes, so I tell the woman attendant I'd like $1,000 cash and the rest in a check. She tells me she'll need my ID and a cologne sample. I say I'm not wearing any cologne. There is a hassle over my ID. They need a photograph to validate my identity. They ask for a photo of me with a moose! I tell them I don't have any such thing, but that I can get a photograph of me with my two siblings, Wally and Ramona. I stand in a circle with the attendant and a group of casino regulators as we discuss and argue over the ID issue. The regulators are against paying me without their conception of \"proper\" ID because they argue it will decrease their odds of winning. The attendant has the check in her hand: a stick of gum. I recognize the evil in gambling: the sickness it is, when all the regulators are there. I have gotten lucky, and should remember that I'm very susceptible to the sickness."

The rod bends sharply. It's a lightweight rod that I don't want to break. The fish runs hard. I am pulled off the ledge and plunge into the water. The fish runs along a small island, in circles. I get to a point where I have taken up some line and seem to have the fish isolated in a pool in front of me."

Norman and I are with our housemate Hank Anderson in his car. Hank is driving. We speed by the people in this field-like area. There are some grassy patches, with dirt and mud. We drive through the puddles, splashing the people that have come to reprimand Norman. Hank, Norman, and I walk away. Norman walks between Hank and I. He is angry because of what has happened. Hank and I try to comfort him: to relax and calm him down, help him forget about the incident. I'm with my friend Niles Zelling and another male friend. Niles is very mad, and he throws a football very hard to release some of his anger."

Gino gets very hyper and angry, throwing one of his fits that he does when we play baseball. I comment on his inability to remain calm. Others and I, including my grade school classmates Patrick Bergman and Jerry Kasper, are near the south end of Bauer or Old Avenue in Oak Valley near the service road that runs below the Main Street overpass. Gino has left the group in one of his fits: mad, pouting, and angry. I yell at him in the distance. I tell him he's weak. My goal is to help him, to make him realize how he's acting. I don't know the best way to go about communicating this to him. Earlier, he and I fought. I punched him. He hated it, but didn't respond. He gets mad at my yelling at him and he turns and starts to run at me in a way that only he can: the tense, rigid, emotionally charged rage and determination. I leave the area where we're playing baseball, leaving Jerry and Patrick. I get around a house out of sight and I start to run at a moderate pace. I know Gino is running after me at full speed. I hope to lose him, cutting through yards and between houses, going towards Carter School. There is a group of boys going to play baseball. I turn around to see if Gino is in sight, thinking he probably won't be. He is about 30 feet away from me, with gritted teeth, full of his transient rage. He has on a pair of thick black-framed glasses. He catches up to me quickly. We may fight: I may punch him between the eyes."

        "dream_content": "TruckinI'm driving a semi-truck. I'm driving a group of young adults, my age, on a fairly long trip. I pull the truck into a gas station in a small town. I'm not really sure where to park, so I just stop next to another truck. People go into the shop to get a break from the driving. The truck starts to slide sideways. I'm outside the cab on the ground. I try to control the slide. It bumps and smashes into the semi-truck next to it, and then bounces back, sliding into the gas pumps on the other side of the truck. I realize I haven't set the parking brake on the truck. I put the parking brake on. The truck then stops sliding. It then slides a bit more. I look at the front tires and see that they're over some hatch-like vents that have popped up, or are up, off of the ground. The truck slides down these hatches about 12 inches. When the truck wheels hit the ground at the bottom of the hatches, I think it is finally stable: it won't slide. The others come out from the store. I don't think anyone has seen the fiasco. I'm especially thinking if the owners of the gas station have seen it, since the truck hit their gas pumps. My housemate Stephen Ramos is among the people there. I have been driving the whole time. Stephen says he would take a turn. I say no, I'll keep driving. I am sore and stiff, but we haven't been driving that long: four to eight hours. I keep driving."

In it are my friends Bubba Hacker and Kevin Simpson. There is smoke filling the cab and pouring out of the windows. I think the engine must be on fire. As they pass me I hope that they'll be okay, that their truck doesn't blow up. I walk, coming to a hilltop on one of the smaller hills. I walk down across a sandy dune-like area towards an office that seems to be the headquarters at a campground. I see two women walking there too. Inside the office there are a number of people. They are middle to old aged people and are simple. They are the kind of person who would work in a campground check-in all their life: not intellectually stimulated or educated. I walk into a game room like area. There are several people there playing games like foosball. The room is old. I imagine it to be a 70's-esque pastel green or light blue. A Bare Naked Ladies video is on television there, in cartoon form. My friend Niles Zelling is there. We both feel out of place in such mundane circumstances. He is near a foosball table where a woman is talking to him about the game: they may be about to play. There are five small dark-colored balls on the table in a line. The ball in the center has a dot on it. There may be one ball missing. The lady explains the game in her simple terms. It seems asinine that this woman is explaining foosball to Niles: of course he knows how to play. Yet her rules are different, as if her game is different. I'm with my friend Nat Miller and a middle-aged white woman. She is not unlike my boss Carly Lunch in appearance, but I imagine her to have a much softer voice, and she doesn't smoke. She and I have sex. Nat gives her cunnilingus while I grab and suck her breasts. This goes on a bit, and she nears orgasm. I'm standing naked with an erection, next to her. She is scantily clothed, and may have a shirt on. I approach her to have sex. I see that where I thought she was is a huge man: her husband! I play dumb, saying, \"Oh my god, I'm naked!\" The man is going to kick my ass! I manage to evade his wrath. I hit him in the groin a few times. A bit later a person or I hit him about ten times in the groin with pool balls, while the person only gets hit once. This should allow the person, who may be I, to have enough time to escape."

There are rows of seats that run perpendicular to the screen, on the sides of the space between the screen and the front rows. I know that these seats on the sides are Aquarius seats. I may be poked in the back by a foot. I hear my name. I turn around and see several young women sitting behind me. The woman directly behind me is the one that said my name. She talks to me, saying her name is Amanda _____, that I know her, and seems to ask if I don't remember her. She looks familiar. She is pretty. She has fair, clean skin. I look at her face, trying to identify, to place her. She looks a bit like my cousin Sandra Redding. There are several businessmen to our left. They talk loudly and obnoxiously for a theatre. They move up towards the screen. One of them flips over a chair, like a somersault. The others jump and tumble. They gather in front of the screen, talking loudly. One of them pulls out a handgun and points it at the head of another. There are between three and five men. The man fires the gun, shooting the second man in the head. The second man may fire back. Several of the men then have guns drawn and point them at each other. One man points a gun into another's mouth. The pointee redirects the gun into another man's mouth, who is then shot. There seems to be a blast of glass shards, from a gun, I think. Most or all of the men die.There is a young blond woman working at a gate that lets cars into an area. It's dark. A bus speeds up and crashes through a gate. The woman may want to go after the bus, because that would be a duty of her job, but she would not be very effecting chasing a bus. She gets out a telescope that is three to four feet long. A helicopter flies overhead. She tries to spotlight the helicopter; it seems to be the runaway vehicle. The telescope may be a spotlight. I'm in an uncovered jeep-like vehicle with the woman. She is looking through the telescope as we ride fast. She is supposed to be looking through it with her left eye but seems to be looking with her right eye.A woman is being pulled by a car that is going fast. She may in the car, but is somehow being pulled. She pokes and prods me with a metal wire, like an electrode or a bent clothes hanger. I'm grabbing onto something. The poking is painful. I clench my fists and grip harder, gritting my teeth. I'm biting onto the front of her blue denim bib overalls. I bite harder as she pokes. I may know her, and feel somewhat awkward when I pull away from her after biting her overalls.People are gathering in a small parking lot because it seems to be a safe haven. There is a person who sleeps in a garbage can because it's safe. I am this person. I'm in a large garbage can. I flip the lid down over my head, peeking out of a crack. Other people in the lot are in vehicles. There is a house across the street. It has holes in it that appear to be shot into it. It looks like Swiss cheese. The holes may get larger. The house seems to be a shell, made of just the outside walls. It's falling apart. There is a power that is affecting the house. It is frightening and threatening to me. It is a natural power, like a storm, but is very destructive."

I don't have or use any ammunition. I point my gun and the ducks and pull the trigger. There is a \"click\" sound of the firing pin moving in the absence of a shell. I have a specific plan of attack: I want to kill some ducks, but I don't want to maim any. I want to do this quickly and discreetly. I maim about five ducks or birds. They're all still living and sit on tree branches, clinging to their lives. I know that someone has informed the police that this was occurring. I gather up the dead and dying ducks and put them in the garbage can in back of the house. There is a phone call for me: it is the police. I talk with a male officer. I explain my actions. Knowing there are limits for each species of duck taken, I tell the officer over the phone that I've killed two wooducks, one mallard, one teal, etc, all of which are legal numbers, even though I know I've really shot a bunch of wooducks. The officer asks me about my friend Nat Miller, whom I know was with me when I was hunting. I try to explain to the officer that because Nat is from out-of-state, he doesn't need a license for hunting, just a valid drivers license and a key. The officer asks me questions about this, and I long-windedly make up answers to excuse our actions. The officer finally says, \"Shine up your keys.\" He means he is coming over to look at Nat's key to validate the story."

I have been drinking tea, and my urge to urinate grows. I have to go outside. I'm holding up one edge of a tent, which may be my dome tent. I hold it up with one hand urinate on the ground with the other hand holding my penis. I urinate here, under the tent, because I'm scared to go elsewhere in the darkness. My urine foams and forms puddles as it hits the dirt and soaks in. I wonder about the moisture being a problem when I set the tent down: I know the tent has a plastic sewn-in floor that will probably be fine with muddy ground. I'm inside looking at photographs. There are many old photographs of our family that I've never seen, or have not seen in a long time. There are photographs of my parents, and the kids from the early 1980's. My parents slept out in a tent in the yard, where the sandbox would be. They were having marital troubles. It is later, and I'm going outside to urinate. I walk along the outside of a long white, single-story house. I stand near the end of the house in the dark. There is something there in the darkness. I may get a glimpse of it, or hear it in the bushes. I'm scared. I run away, back into the house where my mom and my sisters are. I feel frantic and frightened. I say I have heard it or seen something. I go into frenzy out of fear and agitation. I run back outside in my frenzy to confront this person or thing. I yell out to it, \"Come on you Jig Monkey!\" I'm fed up. I it there, and it flees. I see the shadow of it as it runs away. It may have pointy ears."

        "dream_content": "The Projection Of My ShadowI'm on a farm with two men my age that may be my friends. The farm has the layout of the Redding farm. The barn is there. We approach a group of birds. We're hunting the birds east of the barn near the big hay shed. I slow as we get closer so I can load my .22 caliber rifle and fire early at the birds, which are crows. Most of the crows fly away. I'm on the second level of the barn. We're planning on shooting some of the birds from the small door opening. I load the clip for my .22. The bullets I have gotten are from my old housemate in New South Wales. Some of the bullets are too thick or too long for the clip. I load three or four rounds into the clip. We're going to shoot crows, owls, and other birds. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A large brown owl is just outside the barn door opening. Kevin grabs it and kills it with his hands and a screwdriver. I have verbally prompted him to do this. There is a man that sees us. He is outside the barn standing a ways off, in the direction of the birds. He yells at us for intending to, or actually killing, the birds. He reminds me of David Hale from the University of Wellington. He has long brown hair. He starts up towards the bran to confront us. We need to flee. I tell the two others to go ahead: I'll catch up. I may say this so I have time to fire a shot and still get away. We flee. We go through the barn on different levels, in stair and corners. I climb in the rafters of one level to hide in a place that I think is a good spot. I lay flat in the rafters. There is a light bulb below me attached to the underside of the rafters. I see my shadow projected onto the floor, even though it should be on the ceiling considering the position of the bulb and myself. I must move, so that when the man comes in to look for us he doesn't see my shadow on the floor. In the route we take as we flee there is a dead grandma lying on the floor. We need to step over the decaying clump of a woman. There is a book there that is either written by or about Bob Mould."

I come to the house a lot to visit my friend Tiny Combs. His parents don't like that I come. There are two entrances in the front of the house: one on the second floor, and one right below it. I go to visit Tiny. It's winter. There is much snow on the ground, with 4-6 inches of fresh powder. There is a long black metal bridge that is on or over the sidewalk to the lower entrance to the house. This bridge is a plow that removes snow from the sidewalk, silently spinning and sweeping the snow away. When I arrive the bridge is spinning to clear the path of snow. This is a clandestine plow, something that happens in secret, like for Tiny to let me in without his parents knowing. I'm wearing a winter parka with a big furry Eskimo-like hood. I pull the hood up as I approach the door so snow doesn't go in my face. Tiny's parents know I'm coming. They may see or hear me. Tiny's father comes out and yells at me in a frustrated manner, \"Get out of here; just get out of here!!!\" I take off running. They think I'm a prowler or a burglar that is nagging them, since I visited yesterday too. I run down the sidewalk going north. I turn left into the alley. I run past a vehicle in the alley near Andy Jones' house. There is a woman and dog standing outside the vehicle, which may be a mini van. I run to the next block into the short alley again, and turn left onto the long alley, going near Booker's back door. There are several feet of crusty snow. I'm in the alley of the block where my home is, where the old blue house was, kitty-corner to our home. A Chevy Blazer roars by, going north, in the alley. I take cover so I'm not seen. People in the Blazer are looking for me. They don't know that the person they're looking for is I: they think the person is a stranger, a nuisance, and a pest. Really it is I, and they don't know."

This paper is moving from person to person across the world. The point is to see what kind of people will come in contact with the paper. The woman wants me to take the paper because I'm low class, because the paper will come into contact with all kinds of wealthy high class people on its journey, so giving it to me would keep the paper's journey in balance. I think this woman is full of crap. I leave, not taking the paper. I walk in the hotel. There are several different theatres in the hotel, each with different color front doors. This place seems to be like Las Vegas. There is a sign for a gambling room. As I walk towards it I see a blackjack table. I have not gone into the room yet: the doors are closed and I'm outside the room. The table is out in the open lobby area. A black woman with long dark hair is at the table dealing cards, apparently to herself. I enter the gambling room to take a look at the poker table in particular, but also just to look around. It's fairly dark. There are some pool and other recreation tables, and a couple slot machines. I wander over to a table that I think is poker. There are several men around the table, playing what I see is pool. One of them immediately asks me to play with teams. They are playing for money. I'm leery of this, and I say, \"I don't know, I'm not very good...\" I look in my pocket and pull the change out. I have $1.50 in quarters, a penny, and a nickel. It costs $36 to play a game. They seem to include me though I don't have money. One of the men on the other team starts playing and puts in five balls consecutively, easily. My partner and I are then out. My partner is a not very good either, maybe not even as good as me: another chump they rounded up as well. We have not played, and have not paid to play. We were in, and now are out. It feels no different, if not a bit relieving that I won't have to do anything. I walk out of the room. There is a very old vending machine with a pastel blue or green front. Nachos cost 59 cents in this machine. A small sign says the machine is closed."

The radiator is on. This is not very good insulation: I feel the heat escaping on the outside of the house. I'm inside near the stereo. I seem to be with a woman who is submissive, or to whom I act very dominant or aggressive. I take two ice cubes from the ice cube tray at the top of the freezer to use in our sex. I hear a faint noise and see a flicker of color reflecting in the main windows. I walk over to the living room and see that the television is on. I think this is strange because I don't think I left it on and no one else is home. I shut it off and go upstairs. I see the light in my housemate Norman Norman's room is on, though I know this to be my housemate Hank Anderson's room. I enter my room and find Norman there. I give him fellatio, and his penis becomes erect. I tell him to turn over, and I rub an ice cube on his anus, which flares out like layers of a blossoming flower, like a vagina. He thinks this is odd. I look over and see my door is open. I try to shut it but it won't stay closed. Hank is in his room, and as far as I know is unsuspecting of this behavior. Norman may think Hank knows. Our sex ends. Norman is in the bathroom wrapped in a towel, about to take a shower. I go in and start to give him fellatio while he is standing there. He still has partial erection. I suck hard. I'm kneeling, and I may urinate into the toilet while performing fellatio. In a short time he says, \"____ ____ oh please stop it.\", which tells me his is in the ever-so-sensitive period at and after ejaculation. I slow and am lighter with my sucking motions. We have locked the door. Norman ejaculates into my mouth. The semen tastes warm and salty. He comments, \"God, Kenneth\", indicating that I'm good at giving fellatio. I feel nauseated from the semen. I spit it in the bathtub and take a drink of the running shower water to rinse my mouth."

We drive north on Home Avenue down the hill. We get to the bottom of the hill and turn right on 3rd Street. As we do a red compact station wagon turns onto Home Avenue, going by us. I see a young man driving it, waving at us. I see it is my friend John Thomas. He puts his car in reverse and backs up, approaching the side of our car while waving. I want my dad to slow down, not sure if John is waving to say hi or if he needs something. John is then driving forward, following us. My dad slows and pulls off to the side of the road, saying he's going to pull over on 3rd Street near the police station. He thinks the police station is still on Bauer Avenue in back of Jefferson School. I tell him that the police station isn't there any more. I'm annoyed, confused, and angry with him for not pulling over right away. He speeds up, doing almost 50 miles per hour, which makes me even angrier because now he's prone to getting a speeding ticket. He seems to be glad that things are speeded up. John has speeded up, following us. We quickly approach a fenced in area with chain link fence gates. My dad drives right through the gates, speeding. There is nothing in the fenced in area. It is unused, like a vacant lot with a few puddles and leaves. We speed though the fences. We pass a few people, maybe including an Asian man, around the wreckage of a car. A police siren wails in the distance in front of us. I think for sure we'll get a ticket. My dad slows down. As the police car approaches us it goes by us to the scene of the accident. My dad has been spared a ticket. There may be another police car going to the scene of the accident. I'm standing with dad nearby. There are two other men with knives. One is closer to us than the other. The one that is further away throws his knife, which sticks in the ground a short ways away from me. The men are challenging us to a fight. I pick up the knife and mock the men, saying it's dull. I do this after rubbing my finger across the back of the blade near the handle. I then realize that this is not part of the blade, and that the actual blade is very sharp! One of the men is Chuck Norris. We fight, eventually all four of us are fighting together. They are very good fighters, and use their skills to make us immobile, by pinching a nerve or poking a precise area of our bodies. They have specific fighting knowledge and tactics. We subdue them. We go into a barn. This seems to have something to do with releasing or disposing of the men we've captured. There is a ledge in or near the barn. Below the ledge the ground is covered with uncooked pasta noodles on one side and seafood on the other side. There are food piles covering the ground. I know that the pasta area is the _ Ocean, whereas the seafood area is the Asian/Indian Ocean. Either I push the two men into this, or they fall because they are beaten and tired. Then I'm in this area without the men. I hear someone coming on the ledge above and I hide. It is the men, and they are physically okay, and following me. I try to evade them, climbing and scurrying around. I hang from a ledge and moving by \"walking\" with my hands. I escape the grasping hand of one of the men. I get to a window in the barn to jump out. It is high up: 30 feet or more. I hang and jump, seeing if my training has paid off: if I can sustain the fall. (What training, I do not know.) It has paid off. I know that I take the fall in many ways, but I don't experience it more than once. As I fall I do several dances: the Rice Walk, the Combo, and the Swag. I land solidly and feel strong. The land is tan and dusty around the barn where the fight was. There may be a group of women about 100 yards from the barn, as if to cheerlead."

My uncle Rusty Redding and his son Melvin are there. I'm in a gray Isuzu Trooper-like vehicle with my cousin Rich Redding. I'm driving; Rich is in the passenger seat. He makes a comment on how he is attached to or likes this vehicle, and how he will miss it and won't know what to do when he is without it. I back the Trooper out of the driveway and park it next to the curb on the right side of the road. It's a stick shift, with a \"sticky\" shifter, not a smooth one. I may put it in gear to park it. My aunt Elaine Grains has bought the house two doors down from the one where we are. I'm walking back towards the house. Someone has a big box of Cuban cigars. They say the cigars were left over from my high school classmate Todd Warden's party yesterday. Todd was sick at his party, and cigars were passed out. I get a cigar and go into the house. I unwrap it, but don't know which end to bite the tip off, so I don't bite it. The cigar unwraps a bit. My uncle Dannie Redding and cousins Henry and Avery King are there. My housemates Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, and my supervisor Carly Lunch are there. There is orange juice in the refrigerator. Melvin is outside playing with a younger cousin. He has a red light, like the ones we're using in physiology lab. He is holding the light, which deflates when he nears a stream of hot air being out by a small heater. I may instruct him on how to avoid this. The family seems to be divided into two groups for a big game. One group consists of adults, who weigh more, and the other group of younger people and kids. It seems to be lopsided, so grandma Redding runs from the one team over to the other waving her arms comically. All of the extended Redding family is then in a big circular gathering. There is cotton candy being made in the center of the circle. Everyone is supposed to get a turn eating this cotton candy, but we all hold back, waiting for others to do so, so as not to be rude. Then someone says that newborns/young people should go first, so Melvin runs up and gets some cotton candy. From there, there is a pause again: people are reluctant to go. Rusty goes and comes back, sitting on my right eating his cotton candy. He says he's not going back to get more. I'm outside with a group of people sitting near the alley at home in Oak Valley at the south end of the garden near the tree. We sit in the dark watching the sky. There are lights that move across the sky at rapid speeds: too fast to be a plane, satellite, or other human object, but too slow to be a shooting star. I say, half joking, that it may be a UFO! One of these objects explodes. I think it has been shot. My friend Sarah Reed is there, behind me. I can't see well because there are branches in the way, so I move. There is a loud blast. Everyone stands up, startled and concerned. I say, \"That was a shotgun\", and then feel silly because many Redding men are there, and I know they know what a shotgun blast sounds like, so my words really just indicated my inexperience. Rusty leaves with Melvin to protect him. More blasts appear, and we see that there are fireworks in the sky. I sit down where I have a better seat. My friend Nat Miller is there. I see the silhouette of a helicopter circling close to us. It's dark and hard to see. I'm concerned about his because it seems like a war helicopter. I know there is one person in it, and later realize there are two. I'm concerned, and as the helicopter starts to come in to land at the north end of our block by the alley, I flee, to get out of sight. I know the men in the helicopter are from the army and will kill indiscriminately. I run out front in the yard, but then cut back towards the back yard. I see the two men approaching from the direction where they landed. They look lethal. I run though the back of Trammell's yard, down near the white house, across Home Avenue, and over a fence near the Giles' yard. There is a large machine at Giles' house that crushes people. There seems to be a narrator now. People are not spared. The army is responsible. There is a big spring in the machine that crushes people."

We're at a small store to get some supplies and fun stuff. Stephen and I look at large packages of water balloons: 20, 100, 500, or 1000 in a package, costing from $3 to $120. Some of the balloons are very large and are too big for water balloons, I think. An old man with a shopping cart is on a beach. I walk up and look at a newspaper in his cart. He comes over, thinking I'm stealing it. I was just showing Stephen a photograph on the front page of a man catching a trout on Lake Erie. It's the fishing opener. I say that it's a trout, but at second glance it looks like a bass. I walk out into the water with my pants on, going knee deep. I see a bunch of clams, some of which are very large. I pick one up. It looks old, having a lot of algae and growth on its shell. Its shell is large: ten inches long, and six to eight inches wide. I grab it with both hands and smack it hard against a rock. I look at it and see that the shell hasn't cracked. I flip it over and smack the other side hard. The shell still doesn't crack, but it's easy to open. I open it and rip the foot out of it and throw it down on the floor. I straighten the top of the clam muscle, to be flat, and it looks like half of a heart."

I seem to be on the Redding family farm, or a farm with open spaces. They two tigers are there, a little ways off. Others and myself are scared of the tigers. Someone hands me a .44 caliber magnum for protection. I open the chamber and see there are no shells in it: the gun is of no use. I go into a small shack, which is the farther north of the two old white sheds at the Redding farm. I try to close the flimsy wooden gate behind me. There's a gap below and above the gate, which wouldn't protect me from the tigers. I look on the shelves of the shed for ammunition. I find many shells that are close to what a .44 caliber magnum shell looks like, and I try them in one of the six chambers, but not many of them fit. I find one that fits. It looks like a longer, thicker .22 caliber shell. The tigers come around and enter the shed. I am terrified. I make no quick movements. I try to act smoothly and calmly, like I'm not worried at all by them. I know the tigers are extremely powerful, self-contained, and potentially deadly for me. They wander through and leave. I know one bullet isn't enough, so I find more."

I ask Melanie which flavor she wants. She points to the second flavor on the list, which is the Giant Tootsie Roll. I tell the waitress that we'll take the Tootsie Roll flavor shake. She tries to get us to order a steak. I am reluctant because it's early in the morning and I don't feel gastro intestinally stable. She tells us to call her if we want to order. Melanie and I move to a different, nicer table because someone else has moved. I squeeze through the space between the seat and the edge of the table, which is a booth. It feels like we're on a date. The waitress brings our shake, which is like a brownie sundae on a plate. We both it eat it with forks. We're overlooking a city park with tall trees. There are some people under a big tree. A branch is high above them. Melanie makes a comment about doing something mischievous with the tree branch, tricking the people.

He takes out a gun. It looks odd, like a special high power rifle, not a black and brown shotgun, like I expected. It has a silver barrel and several connecting parts where the trigger is. There's a small triangle piece that is the scope. It sticks up off the barrel a little ways. I look though it and the edges of the field of view inside the scope are blurred, like in a normal scope. He takes out the bullets for it and shows me. The look like .22 caliber shells: about a half as long and look empty, discharged. The bullets have to be placed over small nub-like projections, like a hairbrush with thick bristles. The shells have to be placed over the numbers, with ten or 20 in a bunch. It takes a long time to load the gun. Grandpa has several small boxes of these shells and a larger shoebox size box of ammunition as well."

Our house has burned down, I understand. We go by a lake on which there are canoes and boats on the other side of this divided highway. My mom tells me our boat was lost in the fire. Someone is going to give Wally $12,000 for his car- a ridiculous amount of money for it. I react, asking why anyone would give so much for such a piece of junk. We drive from the highway, which seems to be the Thru Highway, going north from Superhighway 100 near by teammate Olie Kecker's house. We get to a neighborhood near Riverside school. I have seen a map with a thumbtack hole in frequently visited places. I see our home in Oak Valley and a tack hole worn in there.

The plane zooms in, and I think they must be landing at Powerton, not going all the way to Metropolis. They are big planes: normal size passenger aircraft. I see or am at a large plane whose cargo is being unloaded. There are many pallets and large box structures to be lifted out by a huge forklift that is controlled by hand, using a joystick. I'm then on the back of a flatbed truck. The bed is full of bottles and cans of pop, can bales, and other beverage items. It is very heavy. Machines move, load, and unload the items.

A naked man and several women leaning up against the cab are there. The man or I may urinate out of the moving truck. The naked man then holds the ankles of Adam Sandler, who is now in back of the truck as well. He does this so Adam Sandler can urinate out of the back of the truck without falling out or it. Adam then turns and urinates on a woman in front of him, jokingly. She is sitting up against the cab with her knees to her chest. She kicks and spreads her legs out; her lower body is naked.

They ask us suspiciously what we're doing. I think they've been tipped off that we're doing something wrong. I try to conceal the axe. We're in shallow water near my carp fishing hole. The axe is on the floor of the lake, about 12-18 inches deep. I try to nonchalantly stir up the lake bottom so sediment settles over the axe. The female officer asks me if that is a paddle, pointing behind me. I turn and see the axe handle sticking out of the water a few inches. I try to cover it up, saying that it's just a little paddle that I use, and hope that she won't look at it. She moves towards it. I see the handle is white plastic, and is actually not a handle, but is the leg of a white plastic chair, the kind we have at the Whitman house. I quickly tell the officer that this is actually a chair that I have with me so when I get up into shallow water I can sit in the chair. We both see it's a chair. She doesn't ask me why I said it's a paddle. She thought the white plastic was part of a cooler, and that I had been drinking. She asks me, \"Have you been drinking?\" I reply honestly, smiling, \"No, not today.\" The older male officer says Army is losing. He means losing in college sports. I ask him the score. He said they lost 315 to 17! I know that Duke and Kentucky are in double or triple overtime in college basketball."

Fran is a crew team leader. She is trying to use her key to unlock a glass gate. Her key won't fit the lock. The crew boats are all loaded, I see. I tell them that I have a key to the Science Hall, and can let them in. I'm actually not sure that my key will work: it's a holiday, and door locks may have been changed. I'm in an airport. I see my friend Holly Lapson, who is coming back to Brimson after a very short Christmas break to take a test. She is wearing headphones, and doesn't seem happy. I talk to her, and am concerned about her. Something bad has happened to a friend of hers. I feel sympathy for her, and want to talk with her. She is not very loquacious. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is leaving. She is wearing makeup. I'm in a hurry, but up to this point have not overtly rushed. Now, I start to move quicker. I'm carrying three bags for my friend Esther Thurman. They're not huge, and they are light: I can carry them all right. I also carry a plastic cartridge, about 3x5 or 5x7. I get to the terminal. I need to find a flight departure screen to see if Esther's flight has left yet. There are many computer screens around, like video games. I need to find a particular computer named stigmat, sigmalon, or something like stigma. I look at many computers before I find it. I kneel down to insert the cartridge into the computer. This cartridge will produce a message on the computer from Esther about a departure. I man named Joel that I recognize from Babe Ruth baseball a long time ago walks by, recognizes me, and says hi. I say hi back. I insert the cartridge and attend to the screen. I push button A, and then realize this is wrong, and will cause some unimportant message to come up. I quickly press button B to get the important information. A screen appears that says the flight is now boarding! I should hurry! There is a message from Esther on the screen, saying something like \"You go girl...\". I grab my backpack off a luggage carousel and run! I try to find the gate, which is 23, 27, or 28. I'm frantic! I go the wrong way down a hallway. I realize this and realize where the main hallway to the gates is: back the other way. I turn around and run. I jump off a staircase, over a railing, over the railing of an adjacent staircase, and land on another staircase."

I'm up to bat. The bat is wooden. The pitcher is mean and arrogant. The throws fast, and is throwing at me. I don't swing. I step back, and he throws wildly. Though it's not a usual thing to do in this sort of game, I walk after about seven balls. The pitcher is just too wild. This enables me to get on base and avoid being hit by a pitch. There are five bases. I'm on second. My friend Tom Napper is up after me. He is a weak batter in our lineup. It will be lucky for me to make it home with him batting, unless by a fluke he bloops the ball into the outfield and it takes a bad hop or gets by a fielder. I have to make it home when he is up, or it seems I'm out. He makes contact, and there are errors in the field. I slide into the next base, where the ball is overthrown. I get up and round the bases, scoring at home. Tom rounds the bases too and scores: an inside-the-park homerun. He has driven in 13 (or 15) runs."

He has come around the other way when he heard me knocking. He is not cooperative, and tells me that I can't get my jacket. I get angry! I raise my voice and explain my situation to him. I lie and say that I just put my jacket down for a moment to check my mail, and when I returned it was gone and everything was locked up! Actually, my jacket had been there for a while, but I think that it makes no difference if it was there a minute or longer. I'm angry, and my words convey my disdain for what has happened, and that I want it to be corrected immediately! The man goes into the back and gets my jacket and returns it to me.

I enter the Science Hall with the guitar. Outside it is a nice warm sunny day: T-shirt weather. When I enter I encounter a group of my friends, including Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, Hilary Nano, and others. They're sitting in a group. I join them. I've been strumming one particular chord all the way here. Niles has a guitar. He plays, and I play chords. I don't play well: my chords sound off, but it's no big deal. It's fun. The strings on my guitar are very loose, and need to be changed. I feel very good having this guitar: happy-go-lucky, free, and lively."

We have taken two deer: a buck and a doe. We're at my home in Oak Valley. It's evening. The deer were shot earlier in the day. Jose shot the buck. The Ramos' don't gut the deer. I get mad at them for this because the venison will spoil, and the deer will be wasted. The Ramos' are very nonchalant about this, saying the meat will spoil or has spoiled, and can't be used, oh well. Adam and I feel differently. We say because it's cool outside the meat will be fine. The bacteria _____ need 45 degrees Fahrenheit to grow. It's cool: for sure less than 50 degrees, and probably less than 40. We argue for the use of the meat. I argue that they can't just shoot a deer and not use the meat: one just doesn't do that. It is Brian's birthday. It will be dusk soon: it's 6:15pm now. I hurry to get ready for the evening hunt. I usually like to have much more time than we have now. We go back to hunt. I argue with Stephen and Jose, saying that their logic is terrible, and is ignorant, narrow-minded, and even backwards. Stephen comments critically that they all worked around my schedule just to be here. Franco is driving out to the land, and we ride with. I talk with two men next to me. There is no sense in being on bad terms with members of your own hunting party. I ask them which stand they're sitting in. There is only an hour until dark. The road is covered with pieces of deer antlers. There are new, expensive homes along the road that have been built recently. I'm riding a bicycle down the road, with the two men on the back of it. We enter an affluent neighborhood. We go down a steep hill. The men may now be walking, and I'm riding or walking the bicycle. There are steps that lead down to a garage area, which is very spacious and neatly organized. We go past several rich people. In the garage there are several cars suspended off the floor about 10 feet, held in place hydraulically. I walk under and around them, to a large open shed or garage. The ceiling is about 50 feet high. There are many large metal axe head-like pieces that drop from ceiling to the floor. These are about seven feet long and two to three feet wide, with sharpened edges. There may be between 20 and 50 of them. They drop from the ceiling, crushing or slicing anything beneath them, and are then lifted back up. I try to avoid these, jumping from side to side, running and dodging them. On the other side of this garage-like building is a set of closed doors. I near this other side, and on the wall I see two large rectangular yellow panels. They are arranged vertically, about 20-30 feet long, and a couple feet wide, parallel to each other. I know that now is the main enemy, the full main enemy that I have not yet met. I do not see the main enemy, but know that the time has come."

They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, \"O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes.\" I then get inside the plane. I think, \"No, I don't want to, I feel trapped,\" but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, \"Duck down, or you'll get shot.\" A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot. I am impatient with her. I say, \"If I get shot, the yarn's yours, O.K.? The rest we'll worry about later.\" I go downstairs. Two Seans come in, nonchalantly."

There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, \"Turn right into the driveway.\" He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the \"bad corner.\" I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, \"Let's start at the oldest part.\" It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, \"It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled.\" As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage.

I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement. Both Uncle Joel and he assure me they are still working on marketing my script. I am a little annoyed and frustrated."

I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy.

So Paulina and start walking and soon find ourselves out in a desert area like near M City. No one else is around and the road seems unmarked. We wonder if we are in the right place. I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, \"Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first.\" I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins."

She says her tummy is upset and she had to go to the bathroom and maybe she'll dance, maybe she won't. I say, \"Then I need to know. Take one minute to decide. Either way it's OK.

He smiles and says \"That is interesting.\" He stands by the window as he is about to leave and I try to make conversation about yet another computer: \"That was quite tragic about MAHLER,\" but I don't remember whether Mahler died young or not. I feel embarrassed. Then I try to \"lure\" him with a \"friend,\" a pretty woman like ELSA SUTTER who says she wants very much to meet him because she had heard him conduct last summer!

He is unctuous, intimidating. At one point he socializes with us, then becomes angry at my friend, lifting him up, almost fighting him. My friend owes him a gambling debt. I intervene, telling the intruder to leave. He backs off, appears to go, but loiters outside, before slinking back to the glass door. I walk over to him. In the doorway, I say, \"I'm warning you. I'm going to hurt you.\" He leaves, but not for long. The woman has left. I want to find her, and go outside. It's beautiful here. I'm relaxed."

In the past, he's had trouble with the law, and he tells me about a woman he loved, a drug addict. As we talk, I comprehend the meaning of inner strength. I want to tell him this, but listening, not talking, is right. When we part, I tell him to be strong. I'm aware this means recognizing one's inner strength. The scene changes. It's cold and dark; there is snow on the ground. I walk to the house of a woman I know. Standing in front of the house, in a notebook, in large letters, I print one word. If I stand here much longer people may complain. In the foot high snow, I walk to the house where a family rents me a room. In thirty minutes a young white man will visit me. I wash up before he arrives. He surveys the room. With its brown walls, it is cramped and crowded with furniture and clothes. I tell him I've lived in many places in the past few years, some of them real dumps, this one is not so bad."

Large upholstered chairs, like thrones, are arranged on a balcony, which skirts the four walls of the room. Beautiful brass and wood musical instruments lay on the floor. There are shiny tubas, French horns, old cellos, violins. I say, \"You live here? Just you?\" but I'm thinking, All this space for one person?\" The woman says, \"Yes. This is where I play.\" I imagine as an artist she has subsidized rent. I ask, \"Do you have pets?\" She says no. I say, \"You could have parrots. Or monkeys or dogs. The parrots could fly around.\" I recall the green parrots soaring over a volcanic crater in Masaya, Nicaragua."

Who cares what the staff or students may think.[138]Before entering the room, I peer though the doors small vertical window and recognize several students. The small class will be lead by Mr. Catello, the short balding middle-aged authoritarian music teacher. Where is my notebook? I don't care.

A cross between a skateboard and a horseshoe crab, as the girls titter, I try without success to kick it away. I know that this board, this thing, has life, and slowly, as I stand upon it, it raises off the cement floor, hovers, and Segway-like moves in the direction I tilt or lean. Soon, I'm skyward, speeding through brambles, which I duck or push away, then flying in open space, the clouds below, the horizon before me. Holding my arms up like a champion, I say, \"Look, everyone! Look! I'm flying!\" I'm aware that certain places are better to pass through than others. At an airport or shopping mall, after hovering in a wide-open space, I touch down. A short thin man or woman, a sort of trickster figure, nags me from behind. Whenever I try to hit, or pin and crush this figure against a wall, it cleverly defeats me. The scene changes. With three crones, I'm sitting high up on a white shelf, braced to a white wall, overlooking the malls open space ahead and below. Each crone wears an ornate disguise, a mask cleverly handmade of cloth and fabric and knitted yarn, that fits snugly over the head. \"What are you?\" I ask one woman. \"A fox,\" she says. And it's true. Her mask has a vulpine snout and ears. \"And you?\" I ask a woman who resembles the salesgirl at a local grocery store, and who in life resembles actress Diane Keaton. \"A cucumber,\" she says. \"Oh, you don't look like a cucumber,\" I reply."

I see Judy run past, filled with rage, looking for Leah and me. Will I fight with her if she finds me? I know that Leah is safe. Judy returns, going the other way, then she is gone.

Not long afterward, preparing to leave, as I put on my cap and coat, I ask the cop, \"Have you seen my pack?\" He looks under the bar, nearly pitch black; it's not there. \"Shit,\" I say, and tell him I'll check up front. I imagine seeing someone hoping to walk out with my pack. I imagine confronting the thief."

The tickets are sold by a red haired woman who sits in a small storefront booth. Her makeup and hair are styled after actress Rita Hayworth. I give her money, she hands us tickets and change. But I've given her fifty dollars and she hands Karen only $9.50. At first, when Karen complains, I think she's wrong, and count the bills. But she's right; I complain too.

In a corridor I meet Robert Farjam, a youth known from summer camp, whose bullying I stopped by picking him up and tossing him out of the bunk house, to the surprise of everyone. \"Which room are you in?\" he asks. I say, \"This place is like an insane asylum.\" I tell him all the rooms are the same. I almost say, 'I feel like I'm home.' Having gone outside, wearing new tan colored carpenter's pants that fit well, I run across a wide cement and flagstone plaza, back into the building. Barry Baldwin, a confident youth from high school, walks past in the opposite direction. He is sullen, silent, uncommunicative. I'm feeling confident, athletic, and rip off a gimmicky piece of fabric from the side of my new pants."

A handsome man, a natural leader, enters a crowded restaurant to ask directions from a waiter or chef. Afterward he relates the directions to me and I become angry and critical. I tell him the directions are wrong. Like in Mexico, the chef or waiter did not understand his question; they simply 'yessed' him. I'm aware of being too harsh, too negative. The handsome man suggests we buy a map. It's a brilliant idea. Why didn't I think of it? What common sense! At an upscale bodega we purchase a map similar to those I put on the wall of my apartment in Northampton.[199]The scene changes. As we sit on the second floor of the bodega the handsome man asks what bothers me. \"It's a long story,\" I tell him. I don't want to talk about the war, about my life afterward. I notice that being an immigrant has turned his complexion. In places it's blotchy or red. We continue walking, now only the two of us. At an intersection I anticipate when he will turn, but he changes stride and direction, and cuts me off. Pointedly I ask him, \"Why do you always to that?\""

My mother has something to tell me. \"Closer,\" she says, meaning she does not want anyone to hear, I should move closer to the barrier. The horses large head knocks against the barrier, which in turn hits me. I'm angry, hurt, and my mother does not know it. This is just like her: nagging, pestering, ruining the moment. My mother tells me about fencing practice. Where to go to be on the team. I'm only hurting myself, but to hurt her, I walk away, even as she calls me to come back. The scene changes. At My old high school, where the practice is held, I enter the wrong stairway, which leads to the chem lab. \"I always do this. I never get this right,\" I say. What to do?

While counting the money in my wallet I notice a one dollar bill with spectacular printing error: the reverse side appears on the front and back. We stop at a small stamp and coin shop, where I ask the owner, a short stocky balding man, what the bill is worth. I note the embedded laser anti-counterfeit image, the old time hand pressed office stamp, the Treasury Department's unique currency paper. As we review the lengthy serial numbers he looks for a specific numeric combination. \"Is it worthy anything?\" I ask. His reply is vague, non committal; but then he makes a modest offer, and I suspect the note has significant value and ask for it back. When the owner pretends he no longer has it, I tell him I'll call the police. He does nothing so I make the call. \"My name is Marc Levy. I'm a Vietnam vet. I'm at a store...\" I tell the 911 operator I'm getting angry. I tell her there could be trouble. \"Do you copy?\" I ask. Neither My former girlfriend Karen or I know the address and approximate it. When I hang up, the owner hands me the bill. \"Too late,\" I tell him. \"The cops are coming. I hope someone forgives you. If I had a gun...\" My former girlfriend Karen and I leave. The scene changes. At a dance for wealthy people who are dressed in formal dinner wear, I spot an object someone has dropped on the floor. Discreetly, I pick it up, nonchalantly walk through the dancing couples, and leave. My former girlfriend Karen and I catch a bus. The bus and the road we travel on are identical to An Loc.[200]Soon the authorities or bank robbers arrive. To escape, I jump off the bus. When it's safe, I emerge from the jungle, walk back to the road, frequently call into the jungle, \"My former girlfriend Karen...Karen...Karen.\" But she does not appear or reply. I meet and talk with two American's dressed in dark suites and ties. They're interested in the object I've found; it's a passport case, they tell me, not a wallet, as I had hoped. Is it worth money? I ask. When they try to steal it, I shoot one American, then the other, first in the head, then the lungs. I do this several times. Each time with satisfaction."

I begin walking up a steep trail that's muddy and washed out, letting myself slide backwards, as if skiing in reverse. After finding my way to the water, which is vast and clear, on the way back to the road I'm surprised to see how the water has risen. I wade slowly forward, pushing in front of me a sandbank that acts as a dam, but also accelerates the overspill. Once over the dam, I enter a grim flooded warehouse. The water here is nearly black. It's necessary to walk past a parked bus; at my approach it starts up. The driver, who doesn't see me, comes too close, forcing me to stand clear. The water becomes deeper, swirling, filthy. Hip deep, I wade past a mechanical buoy shaped like an oil barrel. Tethered to a chain anchored to the floor, spinning slowly round, the buoy is capable of dragging me down. Don't the people in charge know any better? The fast moving water, which is filthy, black, polluted, becomes neck deep. Struggling to keep my head above water, I half swim, half tread to a wall, which has banisters I can grasp. I'm not afraid. I can do this. I will not allow myself to drown. The scene changes. Having escaped the warehouse, I descend a narrow stairwell; ahead of me, a Mideast mother, father and child. There is tension here. The cranky child slows them down. At a stair landing the woman stops to tie the child's shoe. When they resume walking the father speaks to his wife in an English accent. When the woman stops a second time I grow impatient. \"Excuse me, Miss,\" I say, wanting to get past her. But she does not move. \"Miss, excuse me.\" Angered by her ignoring me, I imagine pushing her down the stairs, watching her tumble."

I continue walking, but now with the pistol grip of a fencing foil in my right hand. A brawny policeman stops me, asks for identification. It's clear he suspects something, wants to make an arrest. I take out my black nylon wallet, show him my drivers license. He says to repeat the process, but this time show him something with my social security number. He moves closer, trying to intimidate me; he has an enormous cartoon like head. We are face to face, nearly touching, but I do not back down. I show him my military ID card, too late realizing it does not have the number he wants. The scene changes. I'm in a deep lake. Menacing crocodiles slither up and down in the dark water. I call for help. A huge crocodile attacks and bites me. At first I have fear and call for help. But the bite, though powerful, is not painful; the beast is made of flexible green nylon fabric. Still, I can be dragged down. Repeatedly, I punch one beast, then another, on the snout or head. \"Help!\" I'm calling. \"Help!\" But no one comes to my rescue."

In moonlight, through a forest, the three of us walk up a steep hard packed dirt trail. My grandfather falls behind.

Forthrightly, in his easy chuckling way, he says hello as we shake hands. He mentions the four POWs. I have heard of them but only vaguely.

I know. 'Click-click. Click-click.'\" A male jogger, with unruly black hair, and wearing red trunks, runs by. A car winds up the road; I step to one side."

When she goes to a kitchen cupboard for something to eat, to freshen my breath, I tear off a fragment from a large cake coated with chocolate. But the cake is not chocolate and I'm disappointed. My friends wife reaches into a shelf for a bag of rolls. As she stands on a cobblestone floor, she stumbles, nearly falls, climbs to a small cubby atop the cupboard. From there she watches a kitten repeatedly jump at me, claw its way up my sport jacket, like a stubborn goat bang its head into me, bite me, fall to the floor. This happens several times. The biting becomes vicious, painful, causing me to struggle, to yell, \"Stop! Stop!\""

Marc V enthusiastically spreads his arms several times and utters a sing song phrase. The effort is interesting but uninspired. A moment later, with similar results, he tries again, heedless of being impolite. Another boy volunteers. As with Volpe, his effort is avid but stale. These are my impressions, my judgements. As for me, I'm too shy to perform, though I could be much better. The scene changes. Marc V, wearing a 19th century military uniform, is lead from jail. So that he does not run away, the teacher accompanies him, protects him. As part of his punishment, Volpe carries a half-size M16, a small fan at the barrel tip. As he walks forward, his face filled with despair, I consider that by force of will he can overcome the annoyance of the small weapon and fan."

Walking down a muddy embankment, careful so as not to fall, I lose my footing and slide into the murky water, which is back lit by the sun. A large sleek fish, half shark, half trout, which I had seen before falling in, gnaws steadily at my hands. I struggle to push it away, and wake with fear."

I reach a breaking point, go berserk, lift the women, their possessions, off the ground; like rag dolls toss them repeatedly down. One woman, cocooned in a tangle of dark curly hair, clothes and blankets, lays motionless, dazed. The other woman stares aimlessly into space. Outside, a woman from next door runs past the street level window. I start to leave, to walk up a long ramp, past the aimless woman, to tell our neighbors what I've done."

I take off running, jump over the water, fall short, manage to pull myself up to the old wooden dock. With strength and agility, I grasp a windows safety bars, contort, wriggle, work my way into the darkened house. Anyone watching will have noticed my strong fit body, my tight firm abs."

My mother stands in the open upstairs doorway. \"Oh, hi mom,\" I say, entering the apartment. \"I bought some things for dinner,\" she replies. My dog wags her tail excitedly.

I'm going to die.\" I pluck a full magazine from the bandolier of a dead or wounded soldier but in the chaos I keep pushing it into the magazine well the wrong way. The scene changes. With little cover, we're setting up a perimeter on a dark earthy hill. I'm neatly laying out the items in my wallet, a few things from my pack. Fifty meters ahead, a grunt tosses a frag near the mouth of a cave. There is the fiery blast, moments later dust and bits of sharp blow toward us. I can tell they're harmless. In a kind voice I say to the grunt, \"I wish you hadn't done that.\""

The craft resembles a large upturned copper kettle, its entire surface, like tooled leather, pocked by hammer blows. Set in brass sashes, small circular windows gird its sides. I sit nearby, watching, offering encouragement. Initially, things look well. The craft lifts up, slowly circles the field. It begins to wobble. \"Straighten out,\" I yell to the men inside. The unsteady space ship makes several dips, lazily falls to the ground, tumbles to a stand still. At once, I rush to the overturned thing, call out to the men trapped inside, collect the delicate brass gears, unbroken pieces of glass which lie strewn about. The precious parts can be used to repair or rebuild the damage craft. The men inside are unhurt."

When I open that bag, the crumbs fall to the green floor, into the shed. Except for its white speckled linoleum tiles, inside the shed, which resembles the M's unfinished Ivy Street basement, it's dark, dank, forbidding.

Toward the right front of the room, I see an attractive, dark haired, fit and buxom woman wearing a fashionable solid color knit skirt and blouse. She is the one person here I want to meet. To her left sits the young Italian, Joe F. As in high school, he is tall, dark complected, with a swimmer's athletic build. Though not handsome, his large black eyes dominate his skull; his black hair, neatly slicked back, is rakishly parted to one side. As in life, he is haughty, conceited, arrogant. The woman, slouched in her chair, avoids eye contact. \"Anyone sitting there?\" I ask Joe, pointing to the empty seat to her right. In his smug way he ignores me. I repeat the question, this time louder, insistent. Still no answer. Drawn by the threat of conflict, I sit next to the woman."

I'm alone in a tiny room similar to one rented in Todos Santos. Is it the wind, is someone trying to enter through the single small window? I imagine hitting them while they're caught in broken glass. The next day, in the forest, on a dirt road, I'm trying to ride a too tall bicycle. The trick is to wheel forward, step on one pedal, then hop on. \"I'll get use to it,\" I tell myself. I pedal up a steep hill, coast down, then ride fifty yards down the straight road, back to Bob. But train tracks have replaced the road, and I imagine speeding up, trying to avoid the train behind me. I imagine being flattened, crumpled to death. I thank Bob for using the grunt photo taken in Song Be. I tell him that by placing it at the end, some people will connect the image with the other pictures of myself. Those few people will understand the deeper meaning of his film."

I step quietly, telling myself Nan must be upstairs; old or sleeping, she can't hear me. By touch, I make my way to the kitchen, tuck a long cylindrical paper bag into a cabinet. I think, \"When she sees this she'll wonder, 'How did that get here?'\" then ignore it. Cat-like, I retrace my steps through darkened rooms, past the hallway with many dark colored wide brim women's hats, each artfully hung on the wall, out to the back yard. But I've forgotten the chain link fence which surrounds it. With no supporting poles, the sagging fence is hard to climb. I manage to grab hold of a shiny white painted tree root and haul myself up, though nearly slipping onto the wet earth. Past the fence, I walk through a peninsular field similar to a boyhood moor on Nantucket. Down below, a petite young woman dressed in a brides white gown, walks this way. She hasn't seen me. I imagine calling out, \"It's the bride of Frankenstein!\" and walk towards her. Seeing me, she turns left. Oh well. From this high ground, I'll jump and fly home. How long will I stay aloft before landing in the sea? From high above a marina, looking down, the boats and walkways resemble beautifully patterned pastel quilts. I'm drifting. Which way is Salem?

Wearing a white plastic apron, he carries a large metal tray filled with hot dogs immersed in water. His catering business is called Dawgies Hot Dogs. Annoyed, I walk toward him, pick up a similar tray, and walk past the crowded table, intending to dump the hot dogs in the garbage can behind the house. How can I do that without being seen? The scene changes. I walk past a tall thin attractive young woman lying on a beach chair on the side walk. She wears a tight fitting green knit dress; her legs are drawn up.

I'm driving a motor boat through a wetland forest. When another boat, driven by a gay man, chases after me, I speed up. Above the engines' roar, in this game of cat and mouse, I hear him laughing. Entering a residential area of homes and narrow winding channels, I accelerate, taking the turns fast, trying to slip away. In wide open, calm water, the chasing boat draws near.

As we fold and stack light green towels, I have trouble folding; over and over I can't get it right. I begin tethering an American flag to a Russian flag. I ask a man what he thinks. He says it's not a good idea. Far down the hall, two men struggle with a gigantic American flag, which they hope to hang inside. Just then, the young woman in charge, who is attractive but heavy set, begins to weep and wail. I'm thinking, \"If you lose fifty pounds you'll be prettier, and your health will improve.\" The first person to reach her, my impulse is to throttle her, but at the last moment I lay beside her, put my arms around her, talk comfortingly to her, kiss her partially exposed breast. She says a man tried to knife her. Is she talking about me? The scene changes. At night, on flat land, I stand outside the mansion. From out of the darkness a thin young woman, followed by her two children, and two greyhounds, walks by. The happy children are carefree; the dogs, friendly but shy. Diminutively, as she passes, the woman says, \"Hello.\" I walk to a brick balustrade overlooking the street. A group of rowdies is approaching. Loudly, they half sing, half chant, a bawdy or militant song. So as not to be seen and likely attacked, I duck down, peering out from spaces between the brick work. Across the street, a young woman, colorfully dressed as a scarecrow, pets a large friendly cat. Seeking affection, the animal is almost human, tenderly pawing the woman, rising up, curling itself into her. As the rowdies pass by, there is nothing to fear. They are young male office workers, with short black hair, dressed in slacks and white shirts, chanting a protest song."
